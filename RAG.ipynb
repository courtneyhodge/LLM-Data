The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Requirements for Major The African American and African Studies interdisciplinary major comprises nine courses (29 credits) taken within a program approved by the student’s AAS advisor. These courses may include classes taken before declaration of the major. In order to declare a major, a student must have taken, or be enrolled in the following: AAS 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to African-American and African Studies I Credits: 4 AAS 1020\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to African-American and African Studies II Credits: 4 NOTE: Students must have an average of 2.0 in the major for it to be considered complete. Course Distribution The major requires a distribution of courses in the following areas and levels, all to be selected from the list of approved courses posted on the Woodson Institute’s website: AAS 1010 and AAS 1020, with a minimum grade of C in each course; One course concerning race and politics; One course in the humanities (art history, drama, English, French, media studies, music, philosophy, religious studies); One course in the social sciences or history, in addition to AAS 1010 and AAS 1020 (American studies, anthropology, economics, history, linguistics, politics, psychology, sociology, studies in women and gender); Three electives selected from a list of approved courses; One course about Africa, which may be fulfilled by requirements (3), (4) or (5) above or (8) below; Three courses at or above the 3000 level, which may be fulfilled by requirements (2-6); and One 4000-level seminar requiring an 18-20 research paper, which may count toward requirement (6) above if applicable. Each semester the Carter G. Woodson Institute publishes a list of courses that satisfy the above requirements. Students should speak with an advisor or with the Director of Undergraduate Programs if they have any questions about how to distribute these courses. Students frequently find that African American and African Studies works well as a double major with another discipline in the humanities or social sciences. Up to three courses (11 credits) in another departmental major or minor may count toward an AAS major, if the courses are among those listed on the Woodson Institute’s website at http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/index.html . Up to six transfer credits from relevant study abroad may be counted toward the major, with the advance written permission of the AAS Director of Undergraduate Programs. Exceptions to any of these requirements are made only upon written petition to the Director of Undergraduate Programs. No petitions are accepted after a student completes the seventh semester. Necessary courses for students to take: AAS 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to African-American and African Studies I Credits: 4 AAS 1020\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to African-American and African Studies II Credits: 4 Distinguished Majors Program in African American and African Studies The Distinguished Majors Program in African American and African Studies affords qualified students the opportunity to do advanced research, and to receive, at graduation, the honor of “Distinction” or “High Distinction.”\\xa0Third-year students with a superior academic record are encouraged to apply. Entry into the program Students are eligible to apply if they have achieved a\\xa0GPA of 3.4 in all coursework prior to application for the program. The applicant must obtain the agreement of a thesis supervisor.\\xa0The supervisor may be any faculty member who offers courses that count toward the AAS major. The thesis supervisor must agree to direct the thesis research, and the applicant must submit the name one appropriate secondary reader.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major In order to declare the major, a student must have completed one anthropology course. Program Requirements Eleven courses (33 credits) taken within a program approved by a departmental undergraduate advisor are required for a major. These eleven courses may include courses taken before declaration of the major, and up to two from outside the Department of Anthropology. Courses taken outside the anthropology department, including courses transferred from other institutions or study-abroad programs, may count toward the area requirements for the major.\\xa0 These credits are subject to approval by a major advisor.\\xa0 The maximum number of credits is limited to six and a minimum of three is typically approved, but normally they may not count toward the above 3000-level requirement for the major. In order to declare a major, a student must have completed one anthropology course. Grades lower than C- (in anthropology) will not count toward the major. No course for the major may be taken on a CR/NC basis. Normally at least 18 credits must be taken after declaration of the major. The major requires a distribution of courses in the following areas: At least one Gateway course: 1010 Introduction to Anthropology, 2120 The Concept of Culture, 2160 Culture and the Environment, 2400 Language and Culture, 2415 Language in Human Evolution, 2450 Language and the Environment, 2800 Introduction to Archaeology, 2820 The Emergence of Cities and States At least one Foundation course: Two of the following three anthropological foundations courses: 1010, 3010 History and Theory of Anthropology, , and/or 3020 Using Anthropology. The faculty recommends that majorsstudents take all both, three, but they must take onetwo. Students interested in pursuing the DMP normally take both 3010 and 3020. One C apstone course: 4591 Majors Seminar, during the third or fourth year. course at the 2000-level (or above) in each of these areas within anthropology: socio-cultural anthropology; archaeology; and linguistics; ANTH 4591 during the third or fourth year; Distributional Electives : one course at the 2000-level or above in each of these areas within anthropology: socio-cultural, archaeology, and linguistic. Upper-level E lectives : At least three courses at or above the 3000 level, in addition to the Foundation and Capstone courses 3010 and/or 3020 and 4591; tThese courses must be taken in the Department of Anthropology at University of Virginia.\\xa0 They may overlap with the Distributional Electives. Students frequently find that anthropology provides a cognate discipline which can be paired with other studies in the humanities and sciences. Many of these students choose to double-major in anthropology and another discipline. Up to six credits in another department major may be counted toward an anthropology major if they are consistent with a student’s overall program. Specific courses, therefore, may be counted toward both majors, but the student must receive approval from a departmental advisor in advance. Exceptions to any of these requirements are made only upon written petition to the Undergraduate Committee of the Department of Anthropology. No petitions are accepted after the completion of a student’s seventh semester. A number of informal activities are associated with the department. Among these is the Virginia Anthropology\\xa0Society of the University of Virginia. Majors are encouraged to attend meetings of the group and to attend lectures and symposia sponsored by the department. The major requires a distribution of courses in the following areas: Gateway Course At least one Gateway course from the following: ANTH 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Anthropology Credits: 3 ANTH 2120\\xa0-\\xa0The Concept of Culture Credits: 3 ANTH 2160\\xa0-\\xa0Culture and the Environment Credits:          3 ANTH 2400\\xa0-\\xa0Language and Culture Credits: 3 ANTH 2415\\xa0-\\xa0Language in Human Evolution Credits: 3 ANTH 2450\\xa0-\\xa0Language & Environment Credits:          3 ANTH 2800\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Archaeology Credits: 3 ANTH 2820\\xa0-\\xa0The Emergence of States and Cities Credits: 3 Foundation Course At least one Foundation course from the following: ANTH 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Theory and History of Anthropology Credits: 3 ANTH 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Using Anthropology Credits: 3 Note: The faculty recommends that majors take both, but one is required.

Upper-level Electives At least three courses at or above the 3000 level, in addition to the Foundation and Capstone courses; these courses must be taken in the Department of Anthropology at University of Virginia. They may overlap with the Distributional Electives. B.A. in Anthropology with a Specialist Concentration Students who major in anthropology have the option to work toward one of three specialized concentrations within the major, which will appear on their University transcript. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major, and\\xa0fulfill the specific concentration requirements as listed below. A student may choose to specialize in\\xa0one concentration only. Specific classes that can be counted toward each concentration can be found in the Appendix below, and on the Department website. Students should consult with concentration faculty when choosing courses, as these lists will be updated periodically, and not all classes will be offered in every semester. When selecting Concentration courses, students should keep in mind that a\\xa0maximum of only two courses (6 credits) from beyond Anthropology (courses with other than an ANTH prefix) can be counted toward the Anthropology major. To declare a concentration, students should meet with the faculty advisor for that concentration. Contact information can be found on the Department website, or from the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Anthropology. The three concentrations are as follows: B.A. in Anthropology with Concentration in Culture and Communication The Culture and Communication concentration in Anthropology offers students a program of study focused on communicative practices across a diversity of world cultures, modalities of embodied discourse, and the technologically mediated channels that increasingly connect people around the globe. Work in this area ranges from the micro-scale of everyday dialogue to the transnational scale of commerce, migrations, politics, and development. The program prepares students to bring critical thinking and holistic conceptual tools to an increasingly globalized workplace. There communicative practices vary across almost every conceivable dimension and\\xa0attention to\\xa0cultural differences can mean the difference between communication and miscommunication, justice and injustice, and even life and death. Culture and Communication introduces students to theoretical approaches from linguistic anthropology, cognitive anthropology, and other anthropological subfields. It\\xa0builds on interdisciplinary ties that include sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, conversation analysis, exchange theory, art, media, and mediated discourse analysis. It thus\\xa0prepes\\xa0students to understand the impact of differing modes of expression, cultural styles, and interactional genres on the accomplishment of group tasks, the creation of human connections, and the building of a globally interconnected world. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology, including the Linguistic Anthropology distribution requirement. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include a total of four, as follows: 2-4 classes from Culture and Communication Concentration Course List A up to 2 classes from Culture and Communication Course List B B.A. in Anthropology with Concentration in Indigenous Worlds Students in this concentration will be exposed to ethnographic studies and anthropological theories devoted to “the Indigenous.” For anthropologists, this term commonly refers to the knowledges and worldviews of the many peoples who are our disciplinary interlocutors around the globe. In American contexts, “Indigenous” usually refers to First Peoples of the Western hemisphere, and includes Native American Studies. At the transnational scale, indigenous peoples’ movements are political realities, converging at sites like the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and\\xa0World Conservation Congress. This concentration takes an unbounded approach, engaging with all\\xa0these perspectives and scales, and many others, without reducing “the Indigenous” to any of them. Students will be given the opportunity to engage with the vast array of possibilities for being human, studying for example both colonial-era encounters, and contemporary Indigenous relationships to issues such as sustainable livelihoods, public health, and environmental care. This concentration offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary learning across two areas of distinction at UVA: Indigenous arts and curation, and the environmental humanities. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include the following: 3 classes from Indigenous Worlds Concentration Course List A 2 classes from Indigenous Worlds Concentration Course List B B.A. in Anthropology with a Concentration in Medical Anthropology, Ethics, and Care Students in this concentration will study a diverse range of factors\\xa0that impact the body, and the ways that people understand, experience, and respond to states of health and illness.\\xa0\\xa0Students will critically examine the complex ethical orientations that shape the manners in which people care for or abandon one another in various conditions of exposure, vulnerability, and well-being.\\xa0 Anthropological knowledge and practice offer a unique resource for questioning our own assumptions on these and other matters. Students in this concentration will use such knowledge to address some of the most difficult problems we face today, and in so doing, help create the world anew. Requirements: Fulfill all non-elective requirements for the B.A. in Anthropology. When choosing electives toward your Anthropology major, include the following: ANTH 2280 Medical Anthropology 4 additional courses chosen from the Medical Anthropology Concentration Course List Independent Study in Anthropology For students who want to work on an individual research project, ANTH 4993 allows considerable flexibility. There is no formal limitation on the kind of project as long as, a faculty member is willing to direct it, but the project should not duplicate what is already available in a regular course. Applicants should have their projects roughly defined when they apply to the faculty member. The normal requirements for ANTH 4993 are a reading list comparable in substance to those in regular courses and a term paper and oral examination at the end of the semester. Distinguished Majors Program in Anthropology Students with superior academic performance are encouraged to apply for the departmental Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in which they write a thesis demonstrating independent study of high quality. The requirements for admission to the DMP are: satisfaction of all College requirements as stated in this Record with a GPA of at least 3.25 in all university courses; a GPA of at least 3.400 in all courses taken as part of the anthropology major; Permission of an advisor, who may be any member of the departmental faculty willing to take on the responsibility of supervising the thesis and is normally someone to whom the students have already demonstrated their ability in an upper-level course; application for admission (normally in the spring semester of the Third Year) to the Director of the Distinguished Majors Program, by declaring their DMP graduation semester/year, and by including their relevant course transcripts showing their two cumulative GPAs, along with the selected thesis topic, and the names of the first and second faculty thesis advisors. On admission, student registers with the primary faculty advisor for ANTH 4998 in the first semester of the Program, and for ANTH 4999 in the second semester for revising and finalizing the thesis in consultation with the two faculty readers. A DMP thesis involving field research on human subjects requires the University’s IRB Approval. This should be acquired before beginning the fieldwork, with the help of the primary faculty advisor. In consultation with the Director of the Distinguished Majors Program. In the final semester of the Program, the student takes into account the criticisms and suggestions of the two advisors and other interested faculty members, and submits a finished thesis of approximately 10,000 words to the two advisors three weeks before the Grades Due date for the semester. For regular Spring Graduation, the thesis is to be submitted by April 15. The level of distinction awarded in a thesis is approved by both the faculty advisors. At the end of the spring semester each year, an oral Presentation of all DMP theses will be held in Brooks Hall Commons. Each Distinguished Major and his/her committee members will be present. Theses Presentations will be open to the public. Friends and faculty are invited. Any prospective and current DMP students wishing help in entering, setting up or conducting their Program should contact the DMP director (see Department website),\\xa0and be\\xa0in contact with their major advisor and the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Course Lists Courses at the 1000 and 2000 levels have no prerequisites or expectations of experience and are open to all students. Courses at the 3000 and 4000\\xa0level are advanced undergraduate courses and often assume that students have previous coursework in anthropology. These are general prerequisites and individual professors may consider other courses within or outside the department to be sufficient preparation. Courses at the 5000 level have third- or fourth-year status and prior course work in anthropology as a general prerequisite. These courses are designed primarily for majors and graduate students, but are open by permission to other qualified, sufficiently motivated undergraduates.

Description of Capstone For the capstone, students will work in teams of 3 or 4 to complete an extensive data analysis project. The students and capstone faculty will work collaboratively to develop a\\xa0hands-on project\\xa0for each team\\xa0to demonstrate knowledge and skill in data analysis, interpretation, and communication. Each project will require the team to determine the nature of the questions of interest; prepare data for analysis; select and perform the appropriate analysis; determine conclusions; and present the results. The capstone project will provide an opportunity to observe how\\xa0students work\\xa0through all aspects of a statistical analysis. Students will be guided and evaluated by the capstone faculty. The capstone experience will culminate with the submission of a final report, and a formal presentation. If a student fails the capstone course, the\\xa0Director of Undergraduate Programs will meet with the student to determine a set of revisions and/or alternative academic activities to complete their project. A student who fails to complete their project may retake the course in a subsequent semester. Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) All catalogs © 2025 University of Virginia.

Department’s Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) is an opportunity for qualified undergraduates to undertake substantial, independent research projects while working closely with department faculty. Participants are prepared for advanced independent research and analysis by a required seminar in art historical theory, methods, and historiography. The program culminates in the submission of a DMP capstone project consisting\\xa0of a significant piece of original research, such as a text with a length of about fifty pages, a digital humanities project, and exhibition project, etc. Students who successfully complete the program receive departmental honors, with a degree of Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in art history. Students should ordinarily declare their intention to apply for admission to the program by the end of the spring semester of their third year with formal application for admission to the program\\xa0submitted to the director of the Distinguished Majors Program. To apply, students must have the approval of a faculty member who has agreed to direct their research. A GPA of at least 3.4 in the major and an overall GPA of at least 3.4 are required for admission. In the fall of their third or fourth year, students enroll in ARTH 4051, DMP\\xa0students in the program are required to enroll in six credits of Undergraduate Thesis coursework with their faculty advisor. ARTH 4998 is taken in the Fall semester and ARTH 4999 in the Spring semester. Once capstone projects are submitted, a committee of department faculty determines degrees of distinction. This evaluation depends above all on the level of accomplishment the project has attained, considered in tandem with the students’ overall performance in the major. In the case that a project fails to meet departmental standards, a determination of no distinction may be made. The committee passes on its recommendations to the Committee on Special Programs.

Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation The Biology Department, in conjunction with the Department of Environmental Sciences, offers an opportunity for students to obtain the Bachelor of Arts or Science in Biology with a Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation. Candidates for the Specialization must fulfill all the requirements for the biology major. Many of the courses in this Specialization also count towards the major. The requirements for the Specialization are as follows: two introductory courses in conservation biology (EVSC 2220, BIOL 3450),\\xa0an upper level course (BIOL 4130) and a 3-credit seminar in conservation (EVSC 4991). In addition the Specialization requires at least one course in each of the following areas: Biological diversity: a course focused on a particular group of organisms. Environmental diversity: a course focused on a particular habitat. Techniques in conservation: a course focused on policy, statistics modeling, field methods or geo-spatial analysis. Experience in field studies: this can be fulfilled by independent study, or a summer field course at one of the University’s biological stations (Mountain Lake Biological Station, Blandy Experimental Farm), by involvement with the Africa research program in the Environmental Sciences Department, or by an internship with a conservation agency. Students who are interested in this Specialization should consult with an advisor who is a faculty of the Program in Environmental and Biological Conservation, when declaring their major. EVSC 3200 may be substituted for EVSC 2220 for students that have already taken advanced classes. Distinguished Majors Program in Biology Eligibility Applicants should have a serious commitment to research, with completion of at least one semester of Biology Independent Research (BIOL 4910/4920) and an overall grade point average of 3.400 after completion of at least three semesters of 3000-level or above Biology courses, including at least one core course (BIOL 3000, 3010 or 3020). Application to the Biology Distinguished Majors Program is made at the end of the 2nd or 3rd year. Although an overall GPA of 3.400 is required by UVA for graduation with distinction, research potential will also be a major consideration for admission to the Biology Distinguished Majors Program. Course Requirements All DMP students must complete at least two semesters of Independent Research, as well as the two semesters of the DMP Seminar in Biological Research (BIOL 4810 and 4820). B.A. students are required to complete 24 credits in upper-level Biology courses; B.S. students are required to complete 35\\xa0credit hours in upper-level Biology courses. DMP Students must attain a minimum GPA of 3.400 in all biology courses and overall in the University.

DMP students are required to complete a written DMP Thesis, describing their Independent Research studies (pursued through BIOL 4910/4920/4930). In addition, they are required to deliver an oral presentation of their research at the Richard D. Katz Biology Undergraduate Research Symposium, which is held at the end of the spring semester each year. Certification DMP theses and Katz Symposium presentations will be evaluated by the Undergraduate Committee, together with the Distinguished Major Program Advisory Committee. On the basis of that evaluation, the Undergraduate Committee will recommend to the chair and faculty of the biology department that each degree be awarded with one of the following levels of distinction: with no distinction with distinction with high distinction with highest distinction The decision of the biology faculty regarding each candidate will be forwarded to the Committee on Special Programs and the university registrar prior to commencement. Additional Information Biology courses numbered from 1000 to 1990 are intended to satisfy the College Area Requirements for non-science majors. These courses have no prerequisites. Students selecting the Biology major must complete the introductory courses, BIOL 2100 and BIOL 2200, before taking upper level courses. Students who score \\xa0a 5 on the AP Biology exam, or at least a 6 on upper-level examinations in the International Baccalaureate program, will receive eight credit hours for BIOL 2100 and BIOL 2200. All 3000 level classes require BIOL 2100 and/or 2200. All 3000 level classes count towards upper level course requirements for Biology majors.

Course Requirements All DMP students must complete at least two semesters of Independent Research, as well as the two semesters of the DMP Seminar in Biological Research (BIOL 4810 and 4820). B.A. students are required to complete 24\\xa0credits in upper-level Biology courses; B.S. students are required to complete 35\\xa0credit hours in upper-level Biology courses. DMP Students must attain a minimum GPA of 3.400 in all biology courses and overall in the University. Research Requirements The research project is intended to foster independent thought and to develop the student’s critical ability to formulate and conduct scientific research. DMP students are required to complete a written DMP Thesis, describing their Independent Research studies (pursued through BIOL 4910/4920/4930). In addition, they are required to deliver an oral presentation of their research at the Richard D. Katz Biology Undergraduate Research Symposium, which is held at the end of the spring semester each year. Certification DMP theses and Katz Symposium presentations will be evaluated by the Undergraduate Committee, together with the Distinguished Major Program Advisory Committee. On the basis of that evaluation, the Undergraduate Committee will recommend to the chair and faculty of the biology department that each degree be awarded with one of the following levels of distinction: with no distinction with distinction with high distinction with highest distinction The decision of the biology faculty regarding each candidate will be forwarded to the Committee on Special Programs and the university registrar prior to commencement.

       "  'Text': 'Computer Science, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Degree Programs The BA degree program in Computer Science\\xa0provides students with a solid foundation in computer science theory and practice. An important goal of the program is give students the ability to apply computing to other disciplines in the arts and sciences (e.g., life and physical sciences, mathematics, social sciences, visual and performing arts). This idea of studying computer science in the context of a liberal arts education is what distinguishes the BA in Computer Science from computing degrees in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Graduates of this program will be prepared to apply their technical knowledge to analyze and solve computing challenges in a wide range of problem areas, including those faced by today’s computing industry. Graduates will also be prepared for graduate study in computer science and other fields that require knowledge of computer science. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the (Add school name), students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Declaring the Major and Application Process Students must have successfully completed the pre-requisites described below in order to declare the major. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who have not completed CS 2100 by the end of their fifth semester\\xa0to complete the major in their three remaining semesters. Ability to complete the degree in a timely manner is a factor in acceptance into the major. Second Majors: Because the goals of the degree are integrated with the study of the liberal arts, students from outside the College of Arts and Sciences who have not taken significant coursework in the College will not be allowed to declare the\\xa0BA in CS degree as a second major. Students enrolled in the School of Engineernig and Applied Science are not allowed to declare the BACS as a second major. Transfer Students from Outside the University: Students transferring into the University from other institutions must apply to the department to be allowed to declare the BA in CS major. This should take place during the summer before a transfer student begins classes, and the overall process will be discussed during the summer orientation session. If an incoming transfer does not attend summer orientation, they must meet with a CS advisor before classes begin to discuss their request. Transfer students who start in the spring semester should contact the department when they begin to register for courses. Transfer students who have not completed courses equivalent to the degree’s pre-requisites described below before their first semester in residence cannot be accepted into the major until those are completed. We strongly recommend that students transferring to the University as third-years complete the equivalent of CS 2100 before coming to UVA. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who do\\xa0not complete\\xa0CS 2100 or its equivalent by the end of their fifth semester to complete the BA in CS in the three remaining semesters.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Students must complete the following prerequisites before declaring the Economics major. Complete at least two graded economics courses at the University of Virginia. Economics GPA Achieve an economics grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.3; the economics GPA is a weighted measure of all 2000 level or higher economics (ECON) courses taken at the University with the following exceptions: a. Grades received in courses taken outside the Unviersity’s Economics Department, such as transfer courses or direct credit courses offered through study abroad programs, are no included in the economics GPA. b. If a student is granted economics elective credit for a course taken in another school or department at the University of Virginia, the grade received in that course is not included in the student’s economics GPA. c. HIUS 2061 is cross-listed as ECON 2060, and HIEU 2051 was cross-listed as ECON 2050 until Spring 2015. ECON 2060 is (and ECON 2050 was) the same whether taught under history or economics numbers. A grade in HIUS 2061 (or HIEU 2051 tkaen before Spring 2015), therefore, would be included in the economics GPA. d. If a student fails and course then retakes it, both grades – the failing grade and the grade received on the retake – enter into the computation of the economics GPA. If a student has taken and passed a course, grades receive on any subsequent retake(s) are not included in the student’s economics GPA. Calculus Complete calculus through calculus I (from the courses listed below) with a minimum grade of C+ in the calculus course. MATH 1210\\xa0-\\xa0A survey of Calculus I Credits: 3 MATH 1310\\xa0-\\xa0Calculus I Credits: 4 APMA 1090\\xa0-\\xa0Single Variable Calculus I Credits:          4 a. Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt are permitted to try to meet the prerequisite a second time. Students who twice fail to obtain a grade of at least C+ in these courses, whether in the same or different courses, are ineligible to declare the economics major.\\xa0 Students considering the concentration in financial economics or graduate work in economics are encouraged to take MATH 1310 and MATH 1320 (or APMA 1110 and APMA 2120) instead of MATH 1210 and MATH 1220. b. Pre\\xad-matriculation transfer credit or a grade of C+ or above in MATH 1220, MATH 1320, or APMA 1110 will be accepted in lieu of calculus I to fulfill the prerequisite.\\xa0 However, rule 3a still applies. Students who receive a grade below C+ in Calc I and choose to take Calc II instead of repeating Calc I are using up their second chance under rule 4a above. If they receive a grade below C+ in Calc II, they are ineligible for the major. c. Students who matriculate at the University with AP or transfer credit for one of the aforementioned calculus I or II courses are exempt from this prerequisite.\\xa0Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. Intermediate Microeconomics Complete one of the following with a minimum grade of C+ ECON 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate Microeconomics Credits:          4 ECON 3110\\xa0-\\xa0Mathematical Microeconomics Credits: 4 Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt at completing ECON 3010 (or ECON 3110) are permitted to retake ECON 3010 (or ECON 3110) once. Those who fail to get a grade of at least C+ in two attempts are not eligible to declare an economics major. Credit is not given for both ECON 3010 and ECON 3110, and these courses are considered the same course for the purposes of this requirement. Students who have transfer credit for ECON 3010 at the time that they matriculate at the University are exempt from this prerequisite. Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. Statistics Complete one of the following courses with a minimum grade of C+. STAT 2120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 STAT 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 APMA 3110\\xa0-\\xa0Applied Statistics and Probability Credits:          3 APMA 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Statistics Credits:          3 a. Students who fail to obtain a C+ on their first attempt are permitted to try to meet the prerequisite a second time. Students who twice fail to obtain a grade of at least C+ in the statistics courses listed above, whether in the same or different courses, are ineligible to declare the economics major. b. Students who matriculate at the University with AP or transfer credit for one of the aforementioned statistics courses are exempt from this prerequisite. Transfer credit cannot be used to satisfy this requirement after one has begun taking classes at the University. NOTE: Students declaring in their 6th semester must have either completed or already registered for ECON 3720 or ECON 4720 (STAT 3220, if completed before Fall 2013, is also acceptable). Students declaring after their 6th semester must have already completed ECON 3720 or ECON 4720 (STAT 3220, if completed before Fall 2013, is also acceptable). Declaring the Major 1. Review your student record to make sure you have completed all the prerequistes - the grades must be posted on SIS. If any prerequisites are in progress, you are not yet eligble to declare. 2. Request a guide from the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department on how to complete the online declaration form. The coordinator is also available by email and appointment to answer questions. 3. Complete and submit the DocuSign major delcaration form (available on the Forms Directory of the College of Arts & Sciences website) per the instructions in the guide. 4. Check your Student Information System (SIS) account 5 days after submitting the form to confirm the major has been entered and that a major advisor has been assigned. If the major has not been entered, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department. NOTE: You are not declared until you have completed all four steps. Students are responsible for confirming the major has been entered into SIS. Program Requirements Students must achieve at least a 2.0 economics GPA in order to graduate. Students who finish their sixth semester with an economics GPA below 2.0 will be dropped from the major. Certain courses can be transferred towards the major after a student starts at UVA (post-matriculation), however, certain restrictions apply. For more details, please see the Transfer Credit section on the department’s website. Transfer students must meet all prerequisites. They cannot automatically declare the major. Third-year transfer students considering the economics major are strongly advised to contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator before selecting courses. No course taken credit/no credit may be used to satisfy major and concentration requirements. Students who declare their economics major after Fall 2011 must complete at least four courses in economics at the University of Virginia to graduate as economics majors, whatever transfer credit they may have received for work done elsewhere. For purposes of this rule, any class taught at the University of Virginia in another school or department of the University that is routinely accepted for major credit can be counted towards the total of four courses. Core Requirements Students must complete the following five required courses: ECON 2010\\xa0-\\xa0Principles of Economics: Microeconomics Credits: 3 ECON 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Principles of Economics: Macroeconomics Credits: 3 Each of the Following: ECON 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate Microeconomics Credits:          4 OR ECON 3110\\xa0-\\xa0Mathematical Microeconomics Credits: 4 Each of the Following: ECON 3720\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Econometrics Credits: 4 OR ECON 4720\\xa0-\\xa0Econometric Methods Credits: 3 And ECON 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate Macroeconomics Credits: 3 NOTES Students entering the University with transfer credit for ECON 3010 (or 3020) on their transcript, but do not have credit for ECON 2010 (or 2020), are exempt from ECON 2010 or 2020, respectively. However, they will be required to complete one additional ECON elective; in other words, a total of 5 ECON electives must be completed for the major. Students who completed STAT 3220 before Fall 2013 may use it to meet the ECON 3720 (or 4720) requirement. Declared majors must complete ECON 2010, ECON 2020, ECON 3010 (or 3110), and ECON 3720 (or 4720) by the end of the sixth semester or they will be dropped from the major. Students wishing to declare an economics major later than the end of their sixth semester must have already completed all of these courses. Elective Courses Students must complete 4 elective economics courses, each of which must be at least 3 credit hours. At least 2 courses must be numbered 4000 or above and no more than one 2000 level elective. No economics courses numbered 1000-1999 may be used towards the economics major. Concentrations in Economics The Economics Department offers concentrations in Financial Economics, Industrial Organization, International Economics, and Public Policy. Concentrations are optional , but economics majors whose interests are heavily focused on one of the following areas may want to declare a concentration. Courses taken for a concentration are also considered major electives, unless the course is already specifically required for the major (i.e. Intermediate Microeconomics, Econometrics). Students should keep in mind that elective courses applicable to a concentration are not guaranteed to be offered on a consistent basis. Elective courses taken for a concentration may not be shared with another concentration.\\xa0 In other words, the concentration must stand alone with its own set of elective courses. Concentrations must be declared in the student’s 7th term at latest. Students with questions about a concentration should contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. How to Declare a Concentration: 1. Review your transcript to make sure you have completed all the prerequisites (if any). 2. Contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. 3. The Undergraduate Program Coordinator will provide the reqirued declaration form by email. When the form has been filled out and approved via email, the Undergraduate Program Coordinator will send the completed form to your school’s registrar where it will be entered into your student record. 4. Check your Student Information System (SIS) acount 5 days after completing the form to confirm the concentration has been entered. If the concentration has not been entered, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Economics Department. NOTE: You are not declared until you have completed all four steps. Students are responsible for confirming the concentration has been entered into SIS. Concentration in Financial Economics Goals The concentration aims to provide an academic grounding in financial markets and financial decision making – to teach you how economic theory and econometric methods can be combined to analyze economic phenomena in general and in particular the core issues in financial decision-making. The finance concentration is the most technically challenging of the department’s concentrations. It requires a high level of mathematical and econometric knowledge. Students should be very comfortable applying the tools of calculus to applied problems. Students are also expected to be comfortable with computer programming. Structure The concentration is composed of two parts. Students first take a core set of economics courses as well as COMM 2010 (financial accounting). These courses provide a broad background in financial economics. These courses have long been offered in the economics department and are taught at a level accessible to all economics major. The second part is the preparation for and completion of the capstone course, ECON 4360: Empiricial Finance. The prerequisite for this course is ECON 4720: Econometric Methods. ECON 4720 is needed because ECON 4360 will rely heavily on econometric tools. Half of ECON 4360 will teach students the theoretical basis of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) methodology for pricing assets. The second part of the class will teachs tudents how to use the General Method of Moments (GMM) econometric framework for estimating and testing the validity of a variety of SDF models. Who Should Take the Financial Concentration? The concentration should be of interest to a variety of students.\\xa0 Those who plan to go on to Ph.D. level work in either economics or finance, or masters level work at quantitative finance MBA programs, will benefit from the advanced financial theory and econometric tools we learn and apply.\\xa0 Those who do not have plans for further post graduate study, but who are intellectually curious about finance, will find their curiosity sated.\\xa0 Students heading for quantitative Wall Street jobs will benefit from studying the formal modeling and econometric methods. Notes on Coursework Completing the concentration requires that one plan in advance.\\xa0 Because COMM 2010 is generally taken by pre-Commerce students, first and second year students are given priority in registering for the class.\\xa0 You may find it impossible to register for COMM 2010 if you wait until your third year to take it.\\xa0 ECON 4720 must be completed before starting ECON 4360.\\xa0 While linear algebra is not required for the concentration, concepts of linear algebra appear (and are taught) in ECON 4720 and ECON 4360.\\xa0 Students are required to complete a linear algebra course (MATH 3350 or MATH 3351 or APMA 3080) prior to attempting ECON 4720. Prerequisites for Declaring the Concentration Students must complete one course from the following list: ECON 3720\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Econometrics Credits: 4 STAT 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 STAT 3220\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Regression Analysis Credits:          3 APMA 3110\\xa0-\\xa0Applied Statistics and Probability Credits:          3 APMA 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Statistics Credits:          3 Complete the following course with a grade of B or better. ECON 4720\\xa0-\\xa0Econometric Methods Credits: 3 Requirements for Completing the Concentration In addition to meeting the ordinary requirements for the major, students must: Complete the Following: ECON 3030\\xa0-\\xa0Money and Banking Credits: 3 Complete ONE of the Following: ECON 4340\\xa0-\\xa0The Theory of Financial Markets Credits: 3 ECON 4350\\xa0-\\xa0Corporate Finance Credits: 3 ECON 4365\\xa0-\\xa0Global Financial Markets Credits: 3 ECON 4370\\xa0-\\xa0Behavioral Finance Credits: 3 ECON 4380\\xa0-\\xa0Investment Management Credits: 3 COMM 3720\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate Corporate Finance Credits: 3 Commerce and Economics Double Majors Only Student must complete the course listed below. This course cannot be taken without having met the above prerequisites for declaring the concentration. ECON 4360\\xa0-\\xa0Empirical Finance Credits: 3 Students must complete the course listed below. COMM 2010 does not count as an economics elective. Economics elective courses such as ECON 3030, ECON 4340, etc., taken to meet finance concentration requirements can be counted as electives towards meeting major requirements. COMM 2010\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Financial Accounting Credits: 3 For more information on the concentration in financial economics, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Concentration in Industrial Organization The industrial organization concentration has as its focus on the exercise of market power by firms and the strategic interaction between firms. Courses in the concentration use theoretical and empirical analysis to explore a wide variety of issues related to the functioning of markets and related public policies. In combination with the major requirements, the concentration prepares students for careers in business, law, and consulting. Requirements for Completing the Concentration To complete the concentration, students must meet the ordinary requirements for the major, and complete: ECON 4190\\xa0-\\xa0Industrial Organization Credits: 3 Any TWO\\xa0of the Following: ECON 4010\\xa0-\\xa0Game Theory Credits: 3 ECON 4020\\xa0-\\xa0Auction Theory and Practice Credits: 3 ECON 4110\\xa0-\\xa0Competitive Strategy Credits: 3 ECON 4170\\xa0-\\xa0The Economics of Risk, Uncertainty, and Information Credits: 3 ECON 4180\\xa0-\\xa0Regulating Infrastructure Credits: 3 ECON 4200\\xa0-\\xa0Antitrust Policy Credits:          3 ECON 4390\\xa0-\\xa0The Economic Theory of Advertising Credits: 3 ECON 4195\\xa0-\\xa0Empirical Industrial Organization Credits: 3 For more information on the concentration in industrial organization, contact the Undergraduate Program Coordinator. Concentration in International Economics The international economics concentration is designed for ambitious majors with a keen interest in global economic policy. The core course requirements, ECON 4210 and ECON 4220, develop basic literacy in empirical techniques and international economic theory in international trade and macroeconomics. The remaining course electives allow students to specialize further in economic development (ECON 4230, 4610, 4620) or area studies (ECON 3630, 3640, 4410). Many students combine the international concentration with a study abroad program or with the foreign affairs major.\\xa0 Recent graduates have gone on to work for international governmental and non-governmental organizations, master’s degree programs in international studies or public policy, law school, and business school. Requirements for Completing the Concentration To complete the concentration, students must meet the ordinary requirements for the major and complete: ECON 4210\\xa0-\\xa0International Trade: Theory and Policy Credits: 3 ECON 4220\\xa0-\\xa0International Finance and Macroeconomics Credits: 3 Any ONE of the Following: ECON 3630\\xa0-\\xa0Economics of the Middle East Credits: 3 ECON 3640\\xa0-\\xa0The Economics of Africa Credits: 3 ECON 4230\\xa0-\\xa0Seminar on Trade and Development Credits: 3 ECON 4610\\xa0-\\xa0Economic Development Credits: 3 ECON 4620\\xa0-\\xa0Seminar on Development Economics Credits: 3 ECON 4410\\xa0-\\xa0Economics of the European Union Credits: 3 For double majors in economics and politics, the course listed below is also accepted as an elective for the concentration.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Students may take one of two paths into the major. 1. In the recommended path, students complete one ENGL 2000-level course with a grade of C- or better. This course prepares students for upper-division departmental coursework, and also provides three hours of credit toward the major. 2. In the alternative path, a student who takes two upper-division courses in the department (3000-level or above, in literature not creative writing), with an average grade of B across those courses, may declare the major without enrolling in an ENGL 2000-level course. Program Requirements The degree in English requires ten courses (30 credits), as specified below. All courses must be at the upper-division level (numbered 3000 or above), with the exception of the single ENGL 2000-level prerequisite course. Two courses in the “History of Literatures in English” sequence: ENGL 3001\\xa0-\\xa0History of Literatures in English I Credits:          3 ENGL 3002\\xa0-\\xa0History of Literatures in English II Credits:          3 2. One\\xa0course in literature before 1700 and one course in literature 1700-1900. 3. At least one 4000- or 5000-level seminar in literature (ENGL not ENCW or ENWR). 4. Elective courses to bring the total number of courses to ten. Most students will need five electives, including the single ENGL 2000-level course, in addition to fulfilling the requirements above. Additional Rules 1. Eight of ten courses for the major must be taken in the English department at UVA. With permission of the Director of the Undergraduate Program, up to two major electives may be taken in other departments on campus, or as transfer credit from other institutions, including semester-long study abroad programs. Courses taken outside the department may not fulfill distribution requirements. 2. As one or both of their optional “outside” courses, students may receive major elective credit for courses offered at UVA in the literature of a language other than English, taught either in that language or in translation. These courses may be taught at the 2000-level or above. Grammar and composition courses are not eligible. DUP approval is still necessary for such courses to count toward the major. 3. No more than three courses in total may fall under the writing program rubrics (ENWR and ENCW). Independent Study Only one semester of independent study, in literature or writing, may be counted toward the major. Students may apply to take an indepedent study only if they have completed four 3000- or 4000-level courses in English and they have achieved a major GPA of at least 3.30. Both classes below allow considerable flexibility, with no formal limitations on the project’s nature, as long as a faculty member is willing to direct the independent study. To request an independent study course, students (and their faculty advisors) should apply to the Director of the Undergraduate Program in the semester prior to that in which they wish to pursue their project. ENCW 4993\\xa0-\\xa0Independent Project in Creative Writing Credits: 3 ENGL 4993\\xa0-\\xa0Independent Study Credits: 1 to 4 Grading Standards A minimum GPA of 2.0 in major courses is required. Courses in which a student receives a grade lower than C- will not count toward the major. Concentrations in English The department offers four optional concentrations: Two\\xa0are interdisciplinary in focus: Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and Modern and Global Studies. Two\\xa0allow students to concentrate in the practice of creative writing: Literary Prose Writing and Poetry Writing. Each concentration modifies the English major program of study as specified below.\\xa0Three of them admit students by application only; Medieval and Renaissance Studies is open to all interested. If the area program is selective, students must apply for admission in the spring semester of their second year. For current application deadlines and other questions, please contact the specific Concentration Directors indicated on the English department website. Medieval and Renaissance Studies Students in the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Concentration in English take at least 30 credits for the major. These must include: The English Major Prerequisite (one of two paths, as described above). ENGL 3002\\xa0-\\xa0History of Literatures in English II Credits:          3 Students are encouraged, but not required to take the following course: ENGL 3001\\xa0-\\xa0History of Literatures in English I Credits:          3 At least four other courses (12 credits) in English literature written before 1700, excluding ENGL 3001. At least two of these courses should be at the 4000 or 5000 level. Outside English Concentrators may take Medieval and Renaissance studies courses in other departments, for example, in Art History, History, Religious Studies, Philosophy, and in literatures in other languages. Consequently, in consultation with the Director of the Concentration, 3 such courses (9 credits) may be counted toward the 30 credits required of the concentrator. We strongly encourage language acquisition, especially the study of Latin. Thus, language courses taken in excess of the UVa Foreign/World Language Requirement may also be included in the up-to-9 credits students may present towards the major from outside the English Department. Here follows a partial list of courses that qualify for presentation as part of the 9-credit allowcance; students should consult the Director of the Concentration about approving others that might enhance their particular plans of study. Courses in the medieval and early modern cultures of Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Africa changes topics too often to be included here but are highly recommended. Students in the Medieval and Renaissance Concentration are encouraged to consider an independent study project with relevant faculty in order to develop specialized research ambitions and, if they are qualified, to consolidate their work by writing a thesis in the English Department’s undergraudate Distinguished Majors Program.

       "  'Text': 'Environmental Sciences, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) The Department of Environmental Sciences offers both Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Sciences (B.S.) degrees. The B.A. degree is intended for students interested in environmental sciences, environmental regulation, environmental planning, or secondary school teaching positions. Additionally, this degree can provide a strong base for entry into graduate studies in any of the environmental sciences or in other areas such as medicine, law, or business. The B.S. degree is a more course-intensive experience, excellent for students planning for graduate school or especially for professional careers in the environmental sciences. Each program has an optional thesis program that is an excellent entry into research, and it is recommended for students planning on going to graduate school. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements Students must complete 30 graded credits of departmental course work with a 2.000 cumulative grade point average in major’s courses. The following are core courses: EVSC 2800\\xa0-\\xa0Fundamentals of Geology Credits: 3 EVSC 3200\\xa0-\\xa0Fundamentals of Ecology Credits: 3 EVSC 3300\\xa0-\\xa0Atmosphere and Weather Credits: 3 EVSC 3600\\xa0-\\xa0Physical Hydrology Credits: 3 The lectures and labs for any specific core class should (and, in many cases, must) be taken simultaneously. The interdisciplinary nature of the environmental science’s advanced courses is one of the program’s great strengths and unique features. To take maximum advantage of these courses, students should try to complete the four core courses by the beginning of their fourth year. Three credits of non-core 1000- or 2000-level course work, taken prior to declaring the major, may be counted toward the major. At least 11 credits of non-core courses at the 3000 level or higher must be taken. The department requires one semester of calculus and two semesters of college-level chemistry, biology, or physics with laboratories. Students should begin to to fulfill this requirement in their first year by taking: MATH 1190\\xa0-\\xa0A Survey of Calculus I with Algebra Credits: 4 MATH 1210\\xa0-\\xa0A survey of Calculus I Credits: 3 OR MATH 1310\\xa0-\\xa0Calculus I Credits: 4 Any two of the following: CHEM 1410\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory College Chemistry I Credits: 3 CHEM 1420\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory College Chemistry II Credits: 3 BIOL 2100\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Biology with Laboratory: Cell Biology & Genetics Credits: 4 BIOL 2200\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Biology w/Laboratory: Organismal & Evolutionary Biology Credits: 4 PHYS 2010\\xa0-\\xa0Principles of Physics 1 for Pre-Health Students Credits: 3 OR PHYS 1425\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory Physics 1 for Engineers Credits: 3 PHYS 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Principles of Physics 2 for Pre-Health Students Credits: 3 OR PHYS 2415\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory Physics 2 for Engineers Credits: 3 Although not required for the degree, to do serious research and compete effectively in graduate school and employment, additional math and science is generally needed. Work in any environmental sciences area necessitates developing an understadning of related fields. Thus, to encourage each student’s success in research and the competition for top graduate schools and jobs, the department suggests students take related work based on their primary areas of interest. Ecology depends on a basic knowledge of chemistry (CHEM 1410, 1420) and biology (BIOL 2100, 2200). Geoscience, hydrology, and atmospheric science depend on chemistry and physics (PHYS 2010, 2020 or 1425, 2415) All of these areas depend on calculus (MATH 1190, 1210, 1220, 1310 1320) and the techniques of statistics: STAT 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Statistics for Biologists Credits: 4 STAT 2120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 If the appropriate related work has been accomplished, students can begin the department’s core courses in the first or second year. Students are advised to obtain computer skills and an understanding of statistics as early as possible, and to take additional related sciences as their interests develop. Grading Standards Students must complete 30 graded credits of departmental course work with a 2.000 cumulative grade point average in major’s courses. Transfer Courses Once a student is enrolled at the University, transfer credits that count toward the major must be approved prior to taking the course and must be consistent with the curricular goals of the department. The department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for overseeing the pre-approval of transfer credits. For all degree programs, students who score a 4 or 5 on the Environmental Science Advanced Placement exam will receive 3 credits for EVSC 1010. Any three credits of non-core, lower division courses, or advanced placement credit on the Environmental Science exam, may be counted toward the major if taken prior to the declaration of the majors. NOTE: Only 3 credits of non-core courses below the 3000 level may count toward the major. Requirements for Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation The Department of Environmental Sciences, in conjuction with the Department of Biology, offers an opportunity for students to obtain the Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sciences with a Specialization in Environmental and Biological Conservation. Canidates for the Specialization must fulfill all the requirements for the Environmental Sciences major.

Environmental Sciences Organization The Environmental Sciences Organization , recognized by Student Council, presents an undergraduate professionalization semnar, field trips, career and job search activities, curriculum review and planning, and many social events. All University students are welcome to join. Distinction and Prizes The department participates in the College’s Distinguished Majors Programs designed for highly qualified students. This program must be started early. Information can be obtained from an advisor. Each year, the department gives the following awards to members of the graduating class who have distinguished themselves academically during their four years of study at the University. The Wallace-Poole Award to the most outstanding major. The Wilbur A. Nelson Award, the Mahlon G. Kelly Award, the Michael Garstang Award and the Hydrology Award to students who are outstanding in the areas of geoscience, ecology, atmospheric sciences, and hydrology. An Interdisciplinary Award to the student who has performed the most meritorious interdisciplinary research. The Joseph K. Roberts Award to the student who delivered the best paper at the national conference. The Trout Unlimited Award for excellence in aquatic ecology. Each year, the department also offers the Bloomer and Mitchell Awards for geosciences-oriented students, and the Hart Family Award to support a student pursuing supervised research during their fourth\\xa0year. Research Opportunities Research projects throughout the department provide a number of employment and experience opportunities for undergraduates. Students in their third and fourth years are encouraged to gain research experience by participating in faculty research or their initiating their own research projects with faculty supervision. These projects can be conducted for credit arranging with a faculty member to oversee a Supervised Research project (EVSC 4995) or by conducting an Independent Study (EVSC 4993). Students with a qualifying overall GPA may complete a senior thesis through the Distinguished Majors Program.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school\\xa0Degree Programs page . The Major in History The department encourages students to work closely with faculty to construct challenging, coherent, and integrated programs of study. The major program is structured flexibly to achieve breadth while permitting students to specialize in an area that is of particular interest.\\xa0Students are encouraged to explore new areas by taking courses that focus on periods,\\xa0regions, and themes\\xa0with which they are not familiar. Many history majors choose to study abroad, and faculty advisers are happy to work with students in incorporating foreign study into their major. Optionally, history majors may elect to declare one of the following thematic concentrations: Capitalism and Economic Life; Environment, Space, and Society; Global and Transnational History; Law and Society; Race, Ethnicity, and Empire; or War, Violence, and Society. The requirements for the history major are as follows: 1. Ten history courses of 3 or 4 credits each, taken for a letter grade. a. At least two courses, in any mnemonic(s), concerned principally with the period before 1700. b. At least two courses, in any mnemonic(s), concerned principally with the period after 1700. c. Five courses in distinct mnemonics (HIAF, HIEA, HIEU, HILA, HIME, HISA, HIST, HIUS). d. One Introductory History Workshop (HIXX 3501). Students should complete this requirement before taking the Major Seminar. e. one Major Seminar (HIXX 4501 or 4502) or Major Colloquium (HIXX 4511 or 4512). i. Major Seminars and Colloquia are offered in a wide range of topics. Students should select a Major Seminar or Colloquium whose topic is familiar to them based on their work in at least two previous History courses. ii. A grade of “C” or better is required for the Major Seminar or Colloquium to count toward the major. f. additional courses chosen from among the total offerings of the department to complete a ten-course program of study. g. Students may elect to complete one of the thematic pathways designated by the department (see below, BA in History with a Specialist Concentration). Students must complete five courses from the list approved for that concentration. 2. Of the ten courses required for the major, no more than five may be taken in any one mnemonic. 3. No more than two 1500-level seminars may be counted toward the major. 4. Courses with the General History (HIST) mnemonic count toward the major,\\xa0HIST 4501/4502 or HIST 4511/4512 courses count as the Major Seminar or Major Colloquium. 5. Advanced Placement (AP)/International Baccalaureate (IB) courses\\xa0cannot be counted towards the major. 6. Up to three approved transfer courses may be applied toward the major.\\xa0\\xa0 Courses taken before matriculation transfer toward the major if they have been approved by the University and are on SIS with a History mnemonic (HIAF, HIEA, HIEU, HILA, HIME, HISA, HIST, HIUS).\\xa0 Courses taken after matriculation require departmental approval.\\xa0 Consult the Transfer Credit Approval Procedure link. 7.Courses taken in other departments may not be counted toward the major unless cross-listed in the History Department (e.g., ECON 2061/HIUS 2061). 8. Students\\xa0must maintain a GPA of 2.0 in the major. 9. Before declaring the major, a student should have completed at least one university-level (i.e., UVa or transfer) history course with a grade of “C” or better. This course may be counted toward the ten required for the major. AP or IB courses do not satisfy this prerequisite. 10. B.A. in History with a Specialist Concentration History majors may elect to complete a thematic pathway within the major. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major and select five courses from the relevant list below. A student may choose only one thematic pathway. Concentrations History majors may elect to complete a thematic pathway within the major. To complete a concentration, students must complete all other requirements for the major and select five courses from the relevant list below. A student may choose only one thematic pathway. Capitalism and Economic Life The study of economic life has long been at the core of the historical profession. Modern society’s greatest triumphs, along with its ongoing trials and tribulations, can be traced to the changing forms of socio-economic organization that humans have adopted and the ideas and discourses that motivated them. This pathway explores the processes, practices, institutions, and ideologies that have shaped human economic activity across space and time. It does not limit itself to the quantitative study of the past, but takes a more holistic approach to questions of production, exchange, and consumption over the course of human history. Courses in this pathway closely examine how human practices and institutions have shaped trajectories of economic growth, but also how they sowed the seed of inequality at both the local and global level. Together, we will develop a better understanding of the multiple histories of modern capitalism, but also a sharp sense of the other forms of socio-economic organization that societies engaged in and experimented with. Over the course of the pathway, students will build an analytical toolkit that will help students understand the deep inter-relationships between economy, society and government. They will be able to engage in archival research on questions of economic life across societies and time periods. Students electing to follow this pathway must complete all of the distribution requirements for the B.A. in History and select five courses from the following list: HIXX 1501/1502: Introductory Seminar (designated topics) HIME 2003\\xa0-\\xa0Markets and the Making of the Muslim World Credits:          3 HIST 2001\\xa0-\\xa0Global History Credits: 3 HIUS 2061\\xa0-\\xa0American Economic History Credits: 3 HIXX 3501: Introductory History Workshop (designated topics) HIAF 3051\\xa0-\\xa0West African History Credits: 3 HIEU 3670\\xa0-\\xa0The Fall of Communism: How the Soviet Empire Lost the Cold War Credits: 3 HIEU 3812\\xa0-\\xa0Marx: As Philosopher & Social Scientist Credits:          3 HIME 3195\\xa0-\\xa0Arabian Seas: Islam, Trade and Empire in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean Credits: 3 HIUS 3231\\xa0-\\xa0Rise and Fall of the Slave South Credits: 3 HIUS 3232\\xa0-\\xa0The South in the Twentieth Century Credits: 3 HIUS 3411\\xa0-\\xa0American Business Credits: 3 HIUS 3471\\xa0-\\xa0History of American Labor Credits: 3 HIUS 3753\\xa0-\\xa0The History of Modern American Law Credits: 3 HIUS 3853\\xa0-\\xa0From Redlined to Subprime: Race and Real Estate in the US Credits: 3 HIST 4400\\xa0-\\xa0Topics in Economic History Credits: 3 HIXX 4501/4502: Seminar (designated topics) HIXX 4511/4512: Colloquium (designated topics) HIEU 5352: The British Economy Since 1850 HIME 5053: Slavery in the Middle East and Ottoman Empire HIST 5002: Global History HIUS 5022: Economic Culture in Early America Environment, Space, and Society People shape their history as they engage with the natural world and the built environment.\\xa0 This pathway investigates how they move through space, understand it, and attempt to influence it. It centers on environmental history, the history of landscape and material culture, and the politics of spatial control, among other perspectives. It harnesses approaches from the study of literature, geography, philosophy, and digital humanities to generate new historical knowledge. How do people interact with the spaces around them? How do they reach out to the wider world to shape it? How do their understandings of these spaces, in turn, shape them as individuals and as members of cultures and societies?

Students have the opportunity to explore law’s history in institutional settings—the work of legal professionals, courts, and legislative bodies, and at the national and international level—and to explore more informal modes of legal life. Among topics covered in this pathway are law and human rights, the law of the sea, and the origins of transregional legal regimes; law in relation to race and slavery, in the U.S. and beyond; criminal law in multiple countries; and legal history in and among empires.

Courses in this pathway explore the experience of civil war, international war, and one-sided mass violence in order to better understand how these have shaped and, in turn, been shaped by political, social, economic, demographic, and cultural formations throughout history. These courses also examine the relationship between violence, on the one hand, and sovereignty, state formation, communal or national belonging, citizenship, race, gender, and sexuality, on the other. Faculty teaching in this pathway address all historical eras and regions of the world from antiquity to the present.

The program consists of a two-year course of study. In the fall of their third year participants take a special colloquium on historical theory and methodology, and follow this in the spring with a Major Seminar or Major Colloquium of their choice. The fourth year is devoted to research and writing of a substantial (60 to 90 page) thesis. Distinguished majors must fulfill all the requirements of the history major. Applications for admission to the program are normally accepted in late March of each year from second-year students who have declared – or who plan to declare – history as their major. DMP students are eligible for degrees with distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. The level of distinction is determined by the student’s GPA inside and outside the major (a minimum GPA of 3.4 is required for a degree with distinction), the quality of the DMP thesis, and overall performance in the program. For further information, contact the DMP director or the director of undergraduate studies. The American Studies Major The American Studies Major offers students the opportunity to study the United States in a multidisciplinary context. History majors focusing on the United States can also major in American Studies readily and efficiently, and this double major will deepen and enrich their study of United States history in fruitful ways. Students will be admitted to the American Studies Major after a competitive application process that is normally completed at the end of their second year. Those accepted take, in their third year, two seminars that are available only to American Studies students; a fourth-year seminar in a special topic of American Studies; and seven other courses, to be chosen in consultation with the Director of American Studies, from other departments throughout the college and the university. NOTE: History majors may count some of their coursework in United States history towards the American Studies major. For more information, please contact the Director of the American Studies Program.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements The American Studies major combines interdisciplinary methods to study US culture in its regional, national, and global forms. To declare an American Studies major, students must have completed: At least one university-level (i.e. UVA or college transfer) course in American history or culture, broadly defined (including literature, music, religion, art, anthropology, etc.), with a grade of C or better. AP and IB courses do not satisfy this prerequisite. Students are encouraged to declare the major in their 2nd or 3rd year of study. Students interested in declaring should bring a College declaration form to the office hours of the American Studies Director of Undergraduate Programs or the Chair of American Studies (all hours are listed on the department website). The Director will assign an appropriate faculty advisor who will work with the student to complete a major declaration form. Declaration forms will be processed only in the Fall and Spring semesters. The American Studies major requires a minimum of 10 courses (30 credits). Distinguished Majors Program The Distinguished Majors Program provides a selected group of exceptionally qualified students the opportunity to complete original and significant research on a specific area of interest. Selection for the DMP is a process that takes into account the student’s GPA, intellectual interests, and plans for study. The deadline for submitting application material is in the spring semester of the 3rd year; the exact date will shift slightly from year to year and will be posted on the department website. In close consultation with a faculty advisor, DMP students will design a research topic for independent thesis work during their fourth year. These students must hold a cumulative minimum GPA of 3.4 to qualify for the DMP program and must maintain it to qualify for graduation with distinction. DMP students take an independent study in the fall of their fourth year with a faculty advisor. In the spring of their fourth year they must enroll in the following course with a DMP director: AMST 4999\\xa0-\\xa0Distinguished Majors Thesis Seminar Credits: 3 Throughout the fourth year the DMP student will craft a critical argument, researching and writing on topics that engage in the study of American culture. DMP students demonstrate intellectual rigor and a strong work ethic. The end result is a substantive piece of scholarship, a thesis of approximately fifty pages in length. Please contact the American Studies Director or the Director of Undergraduate Programs for more information. Course Distribution Students must complete with a grade of C or better: AMST 2001\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to American Studies Credits: 3 AMST 3001\\xa0-\\xa0Theories and Methods of American Studies Credits: 3 AMST 4000-level American Studies seminar, Credits: 3 7 additional elective courses (Credits: 21), which must include: 1 course on Historical Approaches, Credits: 3 1 course on Race/Ethnicity, Credits: 3 1 course on Transnational/Regional, Credits: 3 Additional Rules: At least 2 of the 7 electives must be AMST courses. At least 3 of the 7 electives must be at the 3000-level or above. The undergraduate major in American Studies provides a rigorous and diverse program of study that offers students a generous amount of intellectual range and scholarly flexibility, while still remaining rooted in a shared and coherent curricular experience. Requirements for the major include two specific courses that all majors must take. The first of these is Introduction to American Studies (AMST 2001), a 3-credit introductory lecture course that introduces students to the field, its history, and a wide variety of potential areas of study. Students are strongly encouraged to take this course either prior to or soon after declaring the major (i.e. in first or second year), or in their third year if necessary. The second required course is Theories and Methods of American Studies (AMST 3001), a 3-credit, reading-and-writing-intensive course that allows students to more thoroughly explore past and present scholarly currents and an array of theoretical and methodological approaches within the field. Additionally, all majors must take a 3-credit, 4000-level AMST capstone seminar prior to graduating. The capstone course is generally intended to be taken in Fall or Spring of the fourth year. The remainder of the major requirements consist of seven electives (21 credits in total), at least two of which must be taken under the AMST course designation, and at least three of which must be taken at the 3000 level or higher. The first stipulation ensures that students will take at least five of their ten total courses within the Department, ensuring a consistent and coherent academic experience while still providing the flexibility for interdisciplinary exploration. The second stipulation also ensures that students are taking at least five of their ten required courses in an upper-level classroom context, ensuring a suitably rigorous and intensive academic experience. Furthermore, at least three of the seven electives (9 credits) must fulfill one each of the following area requirements (students may not use the same course to fulfill more than one area requirement): Historical Approaches: These are courses that are rooted in a clearly-defined historical scope and that expose students to historical methodologies and/or archival research practices. This requirement assures that American Studies students will graduate with a firm command of the importance of historical context and a nuanced understanding of historical research and historiography. Race and Ethnicity: These are courses that are rooted in questions, topics, and issues related to the fields of critical race and ethnic studies. This requirement assures that American Studies students will graduate with a keen understanding of the ways that ideas about racial and ethnic difference and struggles for recognition and equality have shaped the United States and the American hemisphere more broadly. Transnational and Regional: These are courses that either deal with the United States’ position in relationship to international and global contexts and relations, or that deal with specific regions of the United States itself and the sets of political, social, and cultural concerns facing these regions. This requirement assures that students graduate with an understanding that the United States is far more complex, varied, and diffuse than a simple monolithic nation state, and that the borders of the nation are not the only delineation of “America.” Sample Elective Course List Historical Approaches AMST 1050\\xa0-\\xa0Slavery and Its Legacies Credits: 3 AMST 2559\\xa0-\\xa0New Course in American

Study Abroad Shanghai Chinese Language Program: the UVA-in-Shanghai Intensive Chinese Language Program in the Department of East Asian Languages, Literatures and Cultures at the University of Virginia is hosted by Fudan University.\\xa0 It is intended to enable students who are serious about studying Chinese language in a total immersion environment to cover a year’s worth of material and to earn 8 UVA credits.\\xa0 This rigorous, demanding, and rewarding language program allows the student to have first-hand experience using Chinese in real world situations as well as studying and practicing it in the classroom.\\xa0 For more information, use the “Find a Program” link at http://www.studyabroad.virginia.edu . UVA in Shanghai: Fudan University is offered through the partnership of University of Virginia, Fudan University, and The Education Abroad Network (TEAN). This program offers students the opportunity to spend a semester or year in Shanghai studying Chinese language for direct UVA credit, while choosing from a variety of English-taught electives for transfer credit. Students will take a Chinese Language course at Fudan University, which is offered at the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced level. The Chinese Language program is designed and guided by DEALLC professor Hsin-hsin Liang, and students will receive direct UVA credit. Students will take non-language elective courses taught in English for transfer credit. Elective courses are available in areas such as Marketing, Economics, Management, Accounting, Finance, Sociology, Journalism, History and Political Science. Visit the Academics page on the TEAN website for course listings. Students will also have the option to participate in a part-time internship at a multinational or Chinese organization. Please visit the ISO Education Abroad website and select Program Search for detailed information: https://www.programs.studyabroad.virginia.edu/ . The Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP) is also a consortia program jointly administered by the 14 North American universities distinguished in Chinese studies. Established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1963, IUP has for more than a half century been the gold standard for advanced Chinese instruction, and attracts more graduate and professional school students with China-related career plans than any other language program. Located at Tsinghua University in Beijing since 1997, IUP is headquartered at the University of California at Berkeley. The University of Virginia joined the consortium in 2010. IUP is a purely language instruction program with a proficiency threshold for admission of approximately the completion of third year college-level Chinese. Students are in classes no larger than 3, with daily one-on-one sessions, and enjoy a student-teacher ratio well under 2:1. The basic program is one academic year, but qualified students may attend for the summer, fall, or spring terms only, or any combination thereof. For application, fees, schedule, and other program information, please visit http://ieas.berkeley.edu/iup/. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

The Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP) is also a consortia program jointly administered by the 14 North American universities distinguished in Chinese studies. Established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1963, IUP has for more than a half century been the gold standard for advanced Chinese instruction, and attracts more graduate and professional school students with China-related career plans than any other language program. Located at Tsinghua University in Beijing since 1997, IUP is headquartered at the University of California at Berkeley. The University of Virginia joined the consortium in 2010. IUP is a purely language instruction program with a proficiency threshold for admission of approximately the completion of third year college-level Chinese. Students are in classes no larger than 3, with daily one-on-one sessions, and enjoy a student-teacher ratio well under 2:1. The basic program is one academic year, but qualified students may attend for the summer, fall, or spring terms only, or any combination thereof. For application, fees, schedule, and other program information, please visit http://ieas.berkeley.edu/iup/. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

We recommend checking SIS frequently for environmentally-themed courses, as courses often come and go. Students who wish to have classes not specified here counted against their ETP elective requirements must submit their request plus the full course syllabus to Professor Lawrence.\\xa0 Please give this information to Professor Lawrence by email. ETP elective courses must be upper-level or graduate three- or four-credit classes and they must have environmental concerns as the central focus. Requests to count courses that do not meet these basic requirements will not be considered. Values, Culture, and History electives (Area I) Students may fulfill their one-class requirement for this track by taking any one of the following specific 3-credit classes. If approved by one of the ETP Program Directors, students may count one related 3000-, 4000-, or 5000-level class in History, Anthropology, Philosophy, English, Religious Studies, Landscape Architecture, or Science, Technology, and Society to meet the overall six-course elective requirement, but not to meet the basic one-class requirement for this area. The College allows students to count 18 credits of classes in other schools toward the 120-credit graduation requirement.

DMPs take a year-long independent study with a faculty advisor, with the goal of producing a thesis that is evaluated by outside readers. To participate in the ETP distinguished majors program, set up an appointment with Professor Lawrence during the spring semester of your third year. Credit/No Credit Grades Please note that the ETP program adheres strictly to the College of Arts and Science’s policy regarding classes taken for CR (credit) or NC (no credit). Courses counting towards the ETP area requirements and core courses may NOT be taken on a CR/NC basis. The College does not permit students to take courses on a CR/NC basis in interdisciplinary programs, nor does it permit students to count courses taken on a CR/NC basis towards a major, minor, or College area requirements. Double Majors/Minors Many ETP majors pursue double majors and minors in a variety of other subjects. Please read the requirements about double majoring and minoring set forth by the College of Arts and Sciences. Study Abroad The ETP program does not have any official positions on overseas programs. We recommend that ETP students interested in studying abroad go to other universities’ websites for ETP-like majors and see if there are recommended programs through those universities. \\u2028\\u2028\\u2028In the course approval process, students must go to the UVA departments for which they seek credit. For example, if you would like credit for a civil engineering class taken abroad, you must go to the Engineering Department to file for this credit. Unless it is an ETP course, we cannot approve it for credit. Additional Information For more information contact: Deborah Lawrence, Clark Hall, P.O.

High School Teaching in German For students interested in pursuing a high school teaching career, there are two options in conjunction with the School of Education and Human Development: a five-year program, in which the student may earn two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Teaching, and a 15-month program, the post-baccalaureate Master of Teaching. For more information, contact\\xa0the School of Education and Human Development. GERM 1010 and 1020 These two courses are for beginners. All students with any previous background in German who have not taken the SAT II Subject Test or the Advanced Placement test must take the German placement diagnostic (PLACE) if\\xa0planning to take German at any time in their college career.\\xa0The sequence of courses is: GERM 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Elementary German I Credits:          4 GERM 1020\\xa0-\\xa0Elementary German II Credits:          4 GERM 2010\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate German I Credits:          3 GERM 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Intermediate German II Credits:          3 Once a student has placed in the required course sequence, they must complete each successive course with a passing grade.

All semesters of HBIO 4810, HBIO 4820, HBIO 4998 and HBIO 4999 are graded credit. Required Humanities Elective Credits (three courses) Majors are required to complete three 3000-level or higher courses from the humanities and social sciences. Courses used to fulfill this requirement are relevant to bioethics, healthcare economics, etc. A wide variety of courses are available that could potentially fulfill this area, but those dealing directly with bioethics, health and global health policy and economics, and social impacts of health, are preferred. When in doubt about the applicability of a particular course fulfilling this requirement it is best to seek approval from the Program Director in order to assure that the credits will count toward the major. A number of 3000 to 5000-level Public Health Sciences course can also be used to fulfill this requirement. Examples of courses that could be taken include, but are not limited to the following: PHIL 3790\\xa0-\\xa0Research Ethics Credits: 3 RELG 3860\\xa0-\\xa0Human Bodies and Parts as Properties Credits:          3 ECON 4160\\xa0-\\xa0Economics of Health Credits: 3 PHIL 3650\\xa0-\\xa0Justice and Health Care Credits: 3 Independent Research in Human Biology (optional credits – Third Year only) Students carrying out independent research related to their thesis in the Third Year can sign up for credit by enrolling in the following classes: HBIO 4950\\xa0-\\xa0Independent Research for Human Biology Credits: 2 HBIO 4960\\xa0-\\xa0Independent Research for Human Biology Credits: 2 NOTE: These classes do not replace the fourth year HBIO 4998 and 4999 Thesis research requirements or science elective credits. Second year students who have a strong interest in research and who are planning to enter the Human Biology program are eligible to sign up for HBIO 4950-4960, but must have written approval from the Program Director. College Requirements All Human Biology DMP students are required to meet the general requirements for graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences. Students are not exempt from foreign language, humanities, or writing requirements (excepting Echols students). Students must successfully complete the minimum 120 credit hours required to graduate, of which 102 must be taken within the College of Arts and Sciences. Students graduating from the Human Biology DMP will be permitted to count up to 12 credits of PHS classes taken at the 3000 level or higher for the major as credit inside of the college. In all other aspects, students are subject to the same restrictions for taking classes outside of the College as all other students in the College of Arts and Sciences. GPA Requirement for Distinction All students must maintain an overall GPA of at least a 3.400, and a cumulative GPA of at least a 3.400 in all courses counted towards the major, throughout the fourth year in order for distinction to be awarded with the degree. Admission Interested students currently in their fourth semester in the College of Arts and Sciences are invited to apply for admission to the Human Biology major. As this is a distinguished major, the program will admit only 15-20 new students a year and all applicants should have attained a 3.40 or higher cumulative grade point average. Once admitted to the major, students must maintain an overall GPA of at least a 3.400, and a cumulative GPA of at least a 3.400 in all courses counted towards the major, throughout the fourth year in order for distinction to be awarded with the degree. It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, that prospective applicants complete the prerequisites in biology, chemistry and math prior to application and at least one of the core courses by the end of their second year. Students interested in applying to the major should submit: An official copy of the student’s transcript. A one page statement describing the student’s purpose and goals in pursuing this major and how it will prepare them for their immediate post-graduate academic or\\xa0career plans. A letter of recommendation from an instructor, faculty advisor, or dean. All application materials should be submitted by mid-March (deadline is announced annually; check Program website), to the Human Biology Program Coordinator, Department of Biology, 229 Gilmer Hall. Applications will be reviewed by the faculty advisory committee. Students accepted into the major will be notified by prior to spring and registration for the fall semester. This will allow students to declare a major and select courses during the spring semester advising session. The program director holds an informational meeting for prospective majors in early February to answer questions pertaining to the application process and the major.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Information The major in Japanese provides a distinctive combination of analytical, interpersonal, translingual and transcultural competencies that make students sophisticated and engaged global citizens able to move between languages and cultures in a thoughtful and nuanced manner. The major offers language courses from beginning to advanced levels that develop the ability to read, write, listen and speak effectively in Japanese, as well as connect students with more specialized knowledge in their individual areas of interest, giving them the skills needed to further explore such topics in their own subsequent research or self-study outside the classroom. Students also come to develop an appreciation for contemporary Japanese social and cultural values through their engagement with the language. Content courses on Japanese literature and culture in English provide thematic breadth and historical depth to this understanding by familiarizing students with texts representing more than a millennium of writings including some of the globe’s earliest and most distinguished literary works, and by honing their appreciation of the ways in which the translation and interpretations of these texts are shaped by historical, cultural, social, and linguistic forms of difference. Program Requirements 31 credits with the following distribution: EAST 1010\\xa0-\\xa0East Asian Canons and Cultures Credits: 3 15 credits in JAPN courses at or above the 3000-level, 6 of these credits can come from JPTR courses at the advisor’s discretion JPTR 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Survey of Traditional Japanese Literature Credits: 3 JPTR 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Survey of Modern Japanese Literature Credits: 3 JAPN 4710\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Literary Japanese (Bungo) Credits: 3 JPTR 4991\\xa0-\\xa0Japanese Capstone Credits: 1 3-credit course at the 3000-level or higher taken within or outside of the department and that is not being counted elsewhere towards the major (and approved by both the Course Instructor and Major Advisor), in which the final paper uses Japanese language materials. A maximum of 15 study abroad credits and domestic transfer credits are allowed at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Students must maintain a grade of C or better in\\xa0all courses that count toward the major. Students who wish to double-major are reminded that only two courses may count towards both majors. Study Abroad Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS): the University of Virginia joins Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and about a dozen other Ivy Leagues in running KCJS, a well-regarded study abroad program based in Japan’s historic capital city available for one semester, an entire academic year, or the summer, or the combination of the summer and the fall. \\xa0KCJS’s summer program offers classical and advanced modern Japanese, details for which can be found on the website below.\\xa0 The program requires students to have two full years of college-level Japanese language coursework as a prerequisite, and it works to improve students’ language abilities through small-group instruction tailored to each student’s ability level. Content courses on Japan in the social sciences and humanities are also offered and are typically taught in English. KCJS also facilitates daily use of the language outside the classroom by placing all students who want to take advantage of this opportunity with host families and the community. For more information on the program, application deadlines, and financial aid opportunities, please visit\\xa0\\xa0www.ogp.columbia.edu. In addition to study abroad programs administered by U.Va., students are encouraged to develop their language skills at the many other study-abroad programs that are available throughout East Asia. Please note that in order to receive transfer credit for language courses offered at such programs, students must first consult with our faculty and the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.

Distinguished Majors Program in Neuroscience Students with superior academic performance and serious commitment to independent research are encouraged to apply for the Distinguished Major Program (DMP) at the end of their 2 nd or 3 rd Year. In addition to the core major requirements, DMP students also take the courses listed below.\\xa0The Program culminates in writing a thesis of empirical research done under the mentorship of a UVA neuroscience faculty member. The requirements for admission to the DMP are: Satisfaction of all College requirements as stated in this record with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.400 in the student’s College and university courses; A GPA of at least 3.400 in all courses taken as part of the Neuroscience major; A brief (1-2 page) project proposal along with a written endorsement of the project by a faculty member of the Neuroscience Graduate Program. To gain admission to the DMP, students submit a research proposal to the DMP Director. The names of the primary (i.e., research mentor) and secondary faculty readers must also be included. Once admitted, students register for NESC 4970 in the first semester of the fourth year. In this course, students conduct their research under the supervision of a\\xa0faculty member. In the second semester, students register for NESC 4980 to finalize the thesis, ending with a journal-style manuscript. The research project is intended to foster independent thought and develop the student’s critical ability to formulate and conduct scientific research. The date of the student’s final submission of the DMP thesis to the committee is two weeks before the last day of classes. The two-member faculty committee (mentor and second reader) reports its evaluation of Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction of the thesis to the DMP Director by the first day of the exam period. The PFN undergraduate committee\\xa0 then considers the thesis evaluation, along with the student’s academic record to submit a final level of distinction to the College Registrar. Students receive a letter grade for both NESC 4970 and NESC 4980. These courses do not count toward the GPA of\\xa0the major.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Admission Interested students currently in their fourth semester in the College of Arts and Sciences are invited to apply for admission into this interdisciplinary program. As a distinguished major, the program admits only eighteen to twenty new students a year. A 3.20 cumulative GPA is generally required for admission; the average GPA of recent classes is well above this. The program assumes the students will be in Charlottesville their third and fourth years. It is highly desirable (but not mandatory) that students applying for the PST program should take at least one of the courses listed under the foundations of political and social thought by the end of their second year. Courses taken before admission to the major can be counted toward fulfilling its requirements. Students interested in becoming PST majors should submit: a completed PST application form (available on the PST website); an official transcript a letter of recommendation by a faculty member sent directly to Prof. Smith a 300-500 word essay. This essay should address the following questions: (1) What are your intellectual goals and why are they best addressed in the interdisciplinary PST major? (2) At this (tentative) point, what three area studies will you select in constructing your PST curriculum and why? This answer does not commit students to a particular course of studies if they are accepted into the program; but it should reflect a thoughtful and coherent curricular plan. a writing sample–preferably a previously completed and graded term paper or essay that represents one’s work at its best. a brief statement of one or two significant extracurricular activities, and why the commitment is worth the time. The above materials should be assembled in a manila file folder and placed under Professor Smith’s office door, Gibson S-396, by March 1. (Students studying abroad may submit applications online.) Candidates should hear from the committee by the end of March. The director of the PST program holds a meeting for the prospective majors in early February to answer any questions about admission procedures and program requirements. Students may also obtain this information from the PST website.

An area is defined as a particular intellectual theme or subfield of interest to be investigated in the course of the student’s studies. These areas can be derived from within, between, or outside traditional disciplines. Some examples of area studies might include aspects of modern (or contemporary) political thought; ethical issues in modern economic development, human rights; religion in world politics; identity politics in modern social movements; state-building in third world societies; the modern welfare state; mass media and contemporary social communication; environmental justice. NOTE: An area of study is more specific than simply the name of a department or discipline. For each area, the student must complete two relevant courses, normally at the 3000 level or above. The total of six courses necessary to fulfill the area requirements must be drawn from at least three different disciplines, programs, or departments . In brief: 3 areas; 2 courses per area; 3 disciplines; Total credits:\\xa0 18. Taken together, the three areas of study should be well thought-out and intellectually coherent, and form the general basis of study for the fourth-year thesis. The three areas of study define the interdisciplinary character of the student’s program and must meet a rigorous standard of coherence. In consultation with their advisors and the program director, students are expected to articulate the rationale of their choices in a brief written statement due by the end of the third year. Fourth-Year Thesis - Credits: 6 The PST thesis, of about 80-100 pages, is written over the course of the fourth year. Working with a faculty advisor, students define a topic and engage in serious research, often using primary source materials. The thesis is due on March 31, followed in late April by a full day conference at which students present their completed work. Abstracts of past theses are available on the PST website.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Information The major in Political Philosophy, Policy and Law (PPL) provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to pursue intensive study of the connections between political philosophy and legal theory, legal thought and historical change, law and public policy. The major is based firmly on the view that the study of law has a rich humanistic tradition and that its pursuit encourages sustained reflection on the\\xa0fundamental values of political association. Because the domain of law, policy and political philosophy is huge, a principal objective of the major is the integration of diverse disciplinary perspectives. But interdisciplinary dialogue on political and legal ideas, processes, doctrine, and policies can be fruitful only if the participants engage one another from a position of disciplinary strength. The requirements for the major in PPL are grounded on this presumption. Students may not minor in PPL. Political Philosophy, Policy and Law is a major with\\xa0three components. Majors must take: 1. three co-requisite courses 2. two required PPL courses 3. An individually tailored package of 8 courses that comprise an interdisciplinary core. Students in PPL are encouraged to combine the PPL major with majors or minors in other disciplines, but only two courses used to satisfy requirements of another major or minor may be counted toward PPL. 1. Co-requisite courses (3 Courses) Co-requisite courses must be completed by the end of students’ third year. The co-requisites are: One course in the history of political thought One course in legal history and public policy The following microeconomics course: ECON 2010\\xa0-\\xa0Principles of Economics: Microeconomics Credits: 3 The first two co-requisites must be selected from the following menus: (1) History of Political Theory PHIL 2760\\xa0-\\xa0Classics of Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PHIL 3640\\xa0-\\xa0Political Philosophy Credits: 3 PLPT 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Ancient and Medieval Political Theory Credits:          3 PLPT 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Modern Political Thought Credits:          3 PLPT 3030\\xa0-\\xa0Contemporary Political Thought Credits:          3 (2) Legal History and Public Policy HIUS 3752\\xa0-\\xa0The History of Early American Law Credits: 3 HIUS 3753\\xa0-\\xa0The History of Modern American Law Credits: 3 PLAP 3810\\xa0-\\xa0Constitutional Interpretation: Separation of Powers and Federalism Credits: 3 COMM 3410\\xa0-\\xa0Commercial Law I Credits: 3 NOTE: No more than one co-requisite course may count toward the fulfillment of the requirements for the Interdisciplinary Core. 2.

Distinguished Majors Program Majors in Women, Gender & Sexuality (WGS) with a strong academic record are encouraged to become Distinguished Majors. Distinguished Majors complete a two-semester written thesis (approximately 35-40 pages in length) in their fourth year under the supervision of a WGS faculty member. The thesis allows students to pursue their own interests in depth and have the intellectual satisfaction of defining and completing a sustained project. The Distinguished Major Program is an especially good option for students considering graduate level work in any field. To be eligible, students must have a 3.40 overall GPA at the start of their fourth year. Students are required to sign up for a 6-credit course, WGS 4998 and 4999, under the supervision of a WGS faculty member. The thesis must also be approved by a second faculty member whom the student will choose in consultation with the thesis advisor. The 6-credit senior thesis course will count toward the 30 credits required for the Major. Successful completion of the thesis qualifies the student for graduation with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction, depending upon the recommendation of the two faculty advisors, and subject to approval of the College’s Committee on Special Programs. An early start is important to the successful completion of a Senior Thesis. While not required, it is recommended that students make the decision to pursue the Distinguished Majors Program during their third year. This will give students the opportunity to discuss the project with various faculty members, identify suitable advisors, and have the summer between the third and fourth years to define their project further and begin some preliminary reading and planning. For these reasons, students choosing to pursue the thesis should complete a WGS DMP application form in the spring semester of their third year.

As with the Italian Studies major, students may declare the minor and take courses toward fulfilling it, before they have completed ITAL 2020. These courses will likely be those taught in English on Italian topics (Group B ITTR and C). Before beginning the minor’s core language courses (Group A), students must complete ITAL 2020 or the equivalent, with a grade of C or better. The combination of 6 courses is constituted as follows: Group A: Core Italian Language Courses 2 courses required in total.

Group C: Italian Studies in Wider Context Required: min. 0, max. 2 courses taken in other disciplines/depts. outside ITAL and ITTR; see course list above in Italian Studies Major. Study Abroad The Italian faculty at UVa strongly encourage all Italian Studies majors and minors to spend a term of study in Italy. For most students it is the best way to accelerate language acquisition and significantly deepen academic and cultural experience. The Italian program distinguishes between “recommended” and “approved” study abroad programs. The following two programs are recommended by Italian faculty: UVA in Siena and UVA in Florence. Both offer summer and semester-length study terms. Consult UVa’s International Study Abroad Office for an up-to-date list of approved programs. Students who wish to study in a program that is not recommended or on the approved programs list must go through the petition process run by the International Studies Office, and provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. Even when a study abroad program has been approved, students seeking to satisfy Italian Studies major or minor requirements must have the specific courses approved by the DUP. Students who study in a recommended program may count up to 15 credits per semester of study abroad, or 24 credits per year of study abroad toward their Italian Studies major. Students who study at an approved program in Italy may count up to 12 credits per semester of study abroad or 18 credits for a year of study abroad toward their Italian Studies major. All students wishing to earn ITAL or ITTR credit for work done abroad must have this credit approved by the Italian Studies program. Students are advised to seek more detailed information on study abroad credit transfer on the Italian program web site. Independent Study Based on faculty availability, independent study with a faculty advisor is available to advanced students of Italian who wish to pursue specific areas in depth that are not included in the regular curriculum. For an independent study course to count for the Italian Studies major it must be taken for a grade. Distinguished Major Program in Italian Italian Studies Majors of exceptional ability and dedication are encouraged to enroll in the Distinguished Major Program (DMP). This program enables qualified students to explore at a higher level their interests in Italian literature, language, and culture. Like other Italian Studies majors, DMP students are required to take ten courses (30 credits) as indicated by program requirements. In addition, DMP students in Italian must take an additional 6 credits over the course of the fourth year (3 cr Fall, 3 cr Spring), corresponding to the work they engage in researching and writing a thesis, typically ca. 30 pages in length. In the fall semester of their fourth year, DMP students enroll in ITAL 4980, the DMP Colloquium (a 3-cr credit/no credit course), meeting regularly with the DMP Coordinator to discuss research strategies and set intermediate goals. It is expected that significant work on the thesis will be completed in this semester. In the second semester of their fourth year, DMPs enroll in ITAL 4989, the Distinguished Major Thesis course (3-cr grade option). Students meet regularly with a faculty adviser to receive guidance on advanced research techniques, critical thinking skills, and effective writing strategies. The thesis is completed in this semester, and course credits depend on the successful completion of the thesis. Near the end of the spring semester DMP students present their research results to faculty, graduate students, and invited guests. The DMP will give you the opportunity to: research a topic of interest in depth over the course of a year meet with a professor on an individual basis and receive guidance on advanced research techniques, critical thinking skills, and effective writing strategies share your ideas and enthusiasm with other exceptional undergraduates in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese in a monthly colloquium present your research results to faculty, graduate students, and DMPs in the department at the end of your fourth year Eligibility: Italian Studies Majors possessing a GPA close to a 3.4 are eligible, but GPA alone will not bring automatic admission. Interest, dedication and past record will be taken into account. The last semester of the fourth year, a 3.4 cumulative GPA in all courses is an unconditional requirement in order to graduate with any level of distinction. When to Apply: Students should apply to the program in Spring semester of their third year, by the date indicated by program administrator (usually end of March, early April). Admission will be granted by the DMP Coordinator in Italian Studies. How to Apply: Students must fill out an application form plus secure a written recommendation from a departmental faculty member, and present both to the DMP Coordinator. Program Requirements: DMP Thesis After acceptance into the program (applying in the Spring semester third year), by the end of the second semester of their third year, students will refine their thesis topic in coordination with a member of the Italian Studies faculty serving as the student’s thesis director. (Students who are studying abroad in the spring semester of the third year should select their thesis topic and secure a faculty thesis advisor before the end of the summer before their fourth year.) In the first semester of the fourth year, students will take ITAL 4980, “Distinguished Majors Colloquium,” for three credits [credit/no credit], meeting periodically with the DMP Coordinator and other DMPs to develop research strategies and goals. Substantial work on the thesis will be completed in this semester. During their final semester, students will take ITAL 4989, “Distinguished Major in Italian Thesis,” for three credits [grade option] and complete work on their thesis. DMPs will present their research at a departmental colloquium in the spring of their final year. Theses will be read by the thesis director, a second reader, and the DMP Coordinator, who together will decide on levels of distinction. Details about the format of the final project should be discussed with the DMP Coordinator. A bound copy of the thesis will remain on file in the department’s Del Greco Library. Levels of Distinction: A departmental committee determines different levels of distinction (Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction), based on the quality of the student’s thesis, the student’s overall work in the major field of study, and the student’s overall college record (minimum GPA of 3.4). Distinctions, Grants and Awards The Italian program recognizes outstanding students of Italian in a variety of ways. Each spring, the program hosts its Garden Reception and Awards Ceremony, to celebrate and honor our students of Italian at both undergraduate and graduate levels. At this April gathering we award the Lola Pelliccia Undergraduate Prizes. We also present one or more of our fourth-year students with the Marie M. Giuliano Prize, for demonstrated academic excellence in Italian language study and contribution to the growth and nurturing of Italian at the University. Language Requirement ITAL 1010 is a course reserved exclusively for true beginners, students who have never studied Italian before entering UVA. Students who have studied Italian prior to coming to UVA and who wish to continue in Italian will be placed according to scores obtained on the UVA Italian placement exam. The UVA Italian placement exam is offered only twice a year, on the Monday before the Fall and Spring semesters (registration required). The sequence of courses, depending on the level at which the student begins, is as follows: ITAL 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020; or ITAL 1020, 2010, 2020; or ITAL 2010, 2020; or ITAL 2020. The sequence must be followed to complete the language requirement. Once students begin the sequence of courses, they cannot skip any course in the sequence. Students are not permitted to self-place in a language course. Students who place themselves incorrectly will receive an F for the courses in which they enroll without permission. ITAL 1010 and 2010 are offered in Fall only, and ITAL 1020 and 2020 are offered in Spring only. ITAL 2030 (Italian for Professionals) was introduced in Spring 2018 (as “Italian for Business”) and it may now count as the 4th class in the Italian Language requirement series. All Italian courses to be counted toward the language requirement must be taken at UVA or at a UVA recommended or approved study abroad program. Please note, however:\\xa0 students who seek to fulfill the CLAS Foreign Language Requirement with courses taken at non-recommended abroad programs will be required to successfully pass the placement exam upon return, in order to receive foreign language requirement credit. If exam performance is not satisfactory, students must re-enter the UVA language sequence where they last left it, and may risk losing credit for the language course taken outside of UVA Additional Information For more information, contact current DUP Prof. Francesca Calamita ( f c4j@virginia.edu), 461 New Cabell Hall.

       "  'Text': 'Mathematics, B.A. Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) The study of mathematics develops logical thinking, creative problem solving, and the ability to connect ideas. This makes it highly useful and desired for diverse career paths, ranging from graduate study in mathematics, science and engineering careers, through social science, medical, and business careers. Beyond this practical aspect, studying mathematics develops appreciation for the inherent elegance and beauty of the subject and is thus a deeply rewarding endeavor. The program in mathematics offers courses of study leading to either a minor, or a major in one of several concentrations. The prerequisites to declare and the requirements to complete the major are provided below. For minor program and requirement information please visit the minor program page . The Department, of Mathematics website ( https://math.virginia.edu/ ) provides extensive further information, including background and benefits of the various concentrations, student resources, departmental procedures, and advice on navigating the program and beyond. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisite To declare the major, students must demonstrate proficiency in single and multivariable calculus at the grade level of C or better. Select one of the following options to meet this prerequisite: MATH 2310\\xa0-\\xa0Calculus III Credits: 4 Note: Students may need to complete one or both of MATH 1310 -Calculus I and MATH 1320 -Calculus II\\xa0prior to enrolling in Calculus III. Students should determine their appropriate starting placement in the calculus sequence by consulting with advisors and placement resources on the Department of Mathematics website. MATH 2315\\xa0-\\xa0Advanced Calculus and Linear Algebra I Credits: 4 APMA 2120\\xa0-\\xa0Multivariable Calculus Credits:          4 Complete a course of study at another university or program that the Director of Undergraduate Programs determines is equivalent to one of the above options. Notes: 1. The sequence MATH 1210, 1220 (Survey of Calculus I and II) is insufficient preparation for continuing to Calculus lll and should therefore not be taken by students who might want to major/minor in mathematics or any other field requiring Calculus lll or beyond. 2. The above prerequisite is not part of the major itself. Prerequisite courses do not, factor into the major GPA, are not subject to restrictions on transfer credit, double counting, or other rules pertaining to credit applied to the major. Program Requirements To complete the major, students must complete the requirements for one of the Concentra\\xadtions or General Option below. Each concentration and the general option requires four core courses (the standard or the advanced core), and a set of required and/or elective courses. At least 6 courses offered for the major must have a MATH prefix. All classes used to complete the major must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a C or better, except that two of these may be passed with a C- or better. Restrictions & Exceptions No more than two courses taken from outside the University can be applied to the major or minor. For transfer students, more may be approved by the Director of the Undergraduate Program and transfer credit advisor. Core Requirement The core requirement consists of 4 courses, one each in differential equations, linear algebra, real analysis, and abstract algebra. The standard core is satisfied by either standard or advanced versions of these courses. The advanced core requires the advanced version for some of these courses. Standard Core Note: MATH 3315 must be passed at B- or higher to be used as a core course. If MATH 3315 is\\xa0used to satisfy both the linear algebra and differential\\xa0equations requirements of the standard core, then an additional MATH elective is required for the concentration so that the total number of MATH courses is not reduced.

Students who have been approved for internship credit must enroll in MDST 3800 - Field Experience in Media Studies during the semester of their internship or during the semester immediately following their internship (i.e., a student interning in the summer of 2021 may enroll in MDST 3800 that summer or in Fall 2021). MDST 3800 is a 1-credit course restricted to Media Studies Majors that does not count toward the major requirements. Distinguished Majors Program in Media Studies Prerequisites and Application Students with superior academic performance are encouraged to apply for the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in Media Studies in which they write a thesis or complete a substantial creative portfolio with appropriate documentation demonstrating independent study of high quality. An application is required for entrance to the DMP. Students must apply in the second semester of their second year by the deadline posted on the Media Studies website. The application process is highly selective and takes into account the applicant’s GPA, application essay, as well as other factors. Once accepted, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will guide the student in the preparation of her or his degree plan, in the selection of courses, and who will help the student with all matters related to her or his intellectual pursuits. Prior to applying, students are expected to have complete MDST 2000: Introduction to Media Studies. Exceptions to these pre-requisites are made only at the discretion of the Director of the Media Studies Distinguished Majors Program. Requirements Media Studies DMP students are required to take the following courses: MDST 2000\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Media Studies Credits: 3 to 4 MDST 3000\\xa0-\\xa0Theory and Criticism of Media Credits: 3 MDST 3050\\xa0-\\xa0History of Media Credits: 3 MDST 3504\\xa0-\\xa0Topics in Global Media Credits:          3 MDST 4000\\xa0-\\xa0Media Theory and Methods Credits: 3 MDST 4010\\xa0-\\xa0Distinguished Majors Thesis Writing or Research Project Credits: 3 MDST 4510\\xa0-\\xa0Capstone Topics Credits:          3 DMP students must also complete five (5) MDST electives at the 3000 level or above. The five (5) electives must include courses that fulfill the following criteria: One (1) Practice of Media Course from approved list (Practice of Media course list provided above). One (1) Diversity and Identity Course from approved list (Diversity and Inclusion course list provided above). * DMP students may count a second Practice of Media course as an elective. Students will choose their electives in consultation with their faculty advisor and the Director of the Media Studies DMP. These courses must constitute a plan that furthers the student’s special interest(s). In some cases, and in consultation with the faculty advisor, students may be encouraged to register for MDST 4010 both semesters of their fourth year. DMP students are expected to earn at least a 3.000 (B) in each MDST course applied to the Distinguished Majors Program and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.400 (A-) per university policy. Students who are unable to maintain these academic standards will be put on probation by the Media Studies department for one semester. Students who are not able to raise their grade point averages in the subsequent semester will be asked to leave the DMP but may continue as a Media Studies major provided\\xa0they meet the minimum requirements for that major. Depending on their performance in the DMP, students are eligible to graduate with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction, and such a designation will be reflected on their diplomas.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Requirements for Major This program offers the study of music as an area in the humanities. Students develop their understanding of music through critical and comparative studies; theory and analysis; composition; and development of skills in musicianship and performance. To fulfill the requirements for a major in music, a student must complete at least 31 credits of academic course work. No course receiving a grade lower than C- will count toward major requirements. A student may not use the same course to satisfy more than one requirement. For example, a student may use MUSI 4710 (Instrumental Conducting) to satisfy either an elective requirement or the performance requirement, but not both. Though students can complete the music major in their final two years of college, it is good to begin taking major-level courses earlier. Most 3000-level MUSI courses have minimal prerequisites and thus are suitable as introductory major-level courses. Students planning careers in music should work closely with their major advisor in choosing appropriate courses for their professional goals. Professional preparation typically requires at least 12 credits of advanced departmental course work beyond the minimum major requirements. Eligible students may apply for a Performance Concentration for their third and fourth years. Successful applicants must already be taking, or be eligible to take, lessons at the 3000 level, and have a cumulative GPA of 3.0. In addition to the 31 credits required for the BA in Music, the Performance Concentration consists of an additional 21 performance credits. The Distinguished Major Project in Music allows outstanding music majors to work on large-scale projects during their last two semesters at the University, such as a recital, a thesis, a composition or some combination of these. Students take three credits of independent study each semester (these do not count towards the 31-credit Major). Students completing projects may receive the B.A. with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in Music, provided the cumulative university GPA at graduation is 3.4 or above. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences, whether music majors or not, may apply up to 16 performance credits in music, of which 8 credits must be drawn from 3000-level courses and above, toward the 120 credits required for graduation from the College. In addition, students completing Distinguished Major Projects in Music may earn an additional 4 performance credits, potentially counting 20 credits toward graduation. I.

Four Electives Electives – at least 12 credits. Four additional MUSI courses (at least 3 credits each) numbered 3000 level or above. Of these, at least one must be a seminar, that is, a 4000-level special-topic course, taught with an emphasis on reading and discussion, and in which each student accomplishes substantial original work, either in several projects through the semester or a single, large-scale project. In every case, the selection of electives must have the approval of the music advisor. Performance Concentration The Concentration in Music Performance is a credential, recorded on the transcript, recognizing significant accomplishment in musical performance by majors in the McIntire Department of Music. Admission to the Performance Concentration is by audition. The program serves students who are interested in developing their instrumental or vocal performance skills beyond the level required for the B.A. in Music. DMP students and College Arts Scholars may also earn the Performance Music majors who study with our performance faculty will be eligible to audition for this Concentration. Areas include jazz, classical music, and select genres of non-Western, popular, and folk music. The Following Courses are for Performance Concentration I-II MUPF 3950\\xa0-\\xa0Performance Concentration I Credits: 2 MUPF 3960\\xa0-\\xa0Performance Concentration II Credits: 2 For music majors enrolled in the Music Performance Concentration Program. Prerequisite: at least one semester of 2000-level study and a successful audition, normally to take place in the spring semester of the second year. One-hour weekly advanced lessons (13 per semester), and mandatory participation in the Performance Seminar; graded, 3 credits. Students at this level should make a time commitment to practicing appropriate to the demands of the Concentration Program, to be determined by the individual performance instructors. Students play a jury, i.e. a brief performance for a group of faculty, at the end of each semester, in addition to a 15-30-minute solo performance once per year as part of the Performance Seminar. The Following Courses are for Performance Concentration III-IV: MUPF 4950\\xa0-\\xa0Performance Concentration III Credits: 2 MUPF 4960\\xa0-\\xa0Performance Concentration IV Credits: 2 For music majors enrolled in the Music Performance Concentration Program. Prerequisite: MUPF 3930 and MUPF 3940. One-hour weekly advanced lessons (13 per semester); mandatory participation in the Performance Seminar. For MUPF 4960, fourth-year recital. Graded, 3 credits. Students at this level should make a time commitment to practicing appropriate to the demands of the Concentration Program, to be determined by the individual performance instructors. Students play a jury, i.e. a brief performance for a group of faculty, at the end of each semester, in addition to a 15-30-minute solo performance once per year as part of the Performance Seminar, and a spring semester full recital. Program Eligibility and Application The Concentration provides formal recognition for a few outstanding students who earn musical performance credits at an advanced level and with a coherent plan supervised by an assigned Concentration Advisor. Admission to the Concentration is based on application and audition. By the time of application (deadline announced in the spring semester), all applicants must have: Completed at least one semester of private lessons (MUPF 2xxx, Performance) Passed a successful jury to allow them to enroll in advanced lessons (MUPF 3xxx, Advanced Performance) Declared the Music Major Normally the application and audition process will take place during the spring semester of the second year, so that the students will be in the program in their third and fourth years. Certain talented students may be allowed to audition at the end of their first year in order to enter the program at the beginning of their second year. Candidates must submit an application form [link], accompanied by a written recommendation and approval to audition from their primary private lesson instructor, ensemble director, or other faculty member (an e-mail from them is sufficient). Auditions will be held in March. While audition requirements will vary according to instrument and style, the general requirement will be two or three contrasting pieces or movements from the standard solo repertoire. Consult the relevant private teacher for further details. The jury will consist of the members of the Performance Committee. Upon review of the application and successful completion of the audition, the student will be admitted to the Concentration and assigned a Concentration Advisor. Currently, admission is limited to five students per year. Program Requirements The Concentration requires students to complete the 31 credits of the existing music major, and 21 additional credits in advanced musical performance. To earn the Performance Concentration credential, students must have a cumulative GPA at graduation of 3.0 or above, and a cumulative GPA of 3.4 in all credits applied to the Performance Concentration. Distinguished Majors Program In Music The Distinguished Majors Program allows outstanding music majors to work on large-scale projects during their last two semesters at the University. The project may consist of a thesis, a composition, or the performance of a full recital; a project that combines these components is also possible. Majors normally apply to the program during their sixth semester. After a preliminary discussion with the DUP, a student arranges supervision by a main advisor and another other committee member, and submits a proposal to the DUP. Each spring, the DUP announces detailed application procedures and a deadline. Work on the Distinguished Majors project normally takes place through three credits of independent work in the last two semesters at the University. These credits do not count toward music major requirements. A student working on a thesis or composition normally takes the following course at 3 credits each: MUSI 4993\\xa0-\\xa0Independent Study Credits: 1 to 3 A student preparing a recital normally takes honors-level private performance lessons at 2 credits each, such\\xa0as the following courses: MUPF 4930\\xa0-\\xa0Honors Performance Credits: 2 Students preparing a recital typically take an academic independent study, at one or more credits each,\\xa0pertinent to the recital program: MUPF 4940\\xa0-\\xa0Honors Performance Credits: 2 Projects are due, at the latest, by the last day of classes in the second semester of work; a student’s committee may set an earlier date of completion. The committee evaluates the completed project and submits a report to the full-time faculty. Students completing projects may receive the B.A. with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction in Music, provided the cumulative GPA at graduation is 3.4 or above (a CLAS rule). Any level of distinction is an unusual honor, showing strong Department admiration for a student’s work. The Department awards Highest Distinction only rarely.

Prerequisite for Major Students must have passed at least one philosophy course (a course with the PHIL mnemonic) with a grade of C or better before declaring the philosophy major.\\xa0 The only exception to this policy shall be the following: if a student is currently enrolled in a philosophy course the DUP, in consultation with the instructor of said course, may allow a student to declare the major. Requirements for Major The philosophy major requires a total of 30 credits of courses numbered 2000 or higher.\\xa0 Students who double major may count any six credits from their second major towards the philosophy major.\\xa0\\xa0 These 30 credits must include one course satisfying each of the following requirements: A.

Students who incur a C- in a Philosophy course are placed on probation as majors for the following semester. Further, students whose cumulative GPA in major courses falls below 2.0 will also be placed on probation for the following semester. Absent significant improvement in their academic performance, these students may be discontinued as a major in Philosophy. The Distinguished Majors Program in Philosophy The Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) is designed for students who wish to pursue their studies in philosophy beyond the requirements of the regular major. It requires both the study of a broad range of philosophical areas and a more concentrated examination of a single topic in the form of a senior thesis. DMP students must complete 36 credits of course work in philosophy, no more than 12 of which are at the 2000-level. Courses at the 1000-level cannot be counted towards DMP requirements. The area requirements for the DMP are the same as for the major, except that: (i) the logic requirement must be fulfilled by taking PHIL 2420 or 5420 and (ii) Distinguished Majors must take a Seminar for Majors (PHIL 4010, 4020, or other designated course.) In addition, six of the required 36 credits must be used for the thesis and allocated as follows: PHIL 4993 (Directed Readings) to be used as a pre-thesis research course and PHIL 4999 (Senior Thesis). (The Seminar for Majors and PHIL 4993 will satisfy the college DMP requirement for 6 credits of advanced course work.) Depending on program performance, Distinguished Majors will graduate with Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction. Students normally apply to the DMP at the end of their third year. Students applying at this time must have completed at least six philosophy courses, and must have and maintain a GPA of at least 3.4 in all philosophy courses taken. In addition, they should have an overall GPA close enough to 3.4 to make it likely that they will be able to satisfy the College requirement of a final cumulative GPA of 3.4 for graduation with distinction. Application materials: (i) a brief proposal of a thesis topic; (ii) an up-to-date transcript; (iii) a note from a faculty member indicating that he or she is willing to supervise the applicant’s thesis; (iv) a writing sample. The Philosophy Minor The requirements for the Philosophy Minor are 15 credits of philosophy\\xa0courses. No more than three credits may be below the 2000 level. The program of study should be developed in consultation with a departmental advisor.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Information The Department of Physics offers both Bachelor’s of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees. The Physics, B.A. is designed for students interested in physics and planning to enter other fields including engineering, medicine, education, business, and law, and for liberal arts students seeking a strong background in physics. NOTE: Students planning graduate study in physics or physics-related areas should elect the B.S. or the Astronomy/Physics B.S. Program Requirements There are three groups of courses that are needed for the BA degree: All required courses must be passed with a minimum grade of C. The Schools impose other requirements for graduation; e.g., students in the College of Arts and Sciences need to earn a certain number of credits, and, if not Echols scholars, must fulfill General Education requirements.

Physics courses are more sequential than courses in some other majors. Course descriptions in SIS, or at the department webpage, list other courses that are expected to be taken earlier, or concurrently. Students can substitute APMA 2120 (Multivariable Calculus) for MATH 2310 (Calculus III), APMA 2130 (Applied Differential Equations) for MATH 3250 (Ordinary Differential Equations), PHYS 1425 (Introductory Physics 1 for Engineers) for PHYS 1420 (Introductory Physics 1), and PHYS 2415 (Introductory Physics 2 for Engineers) for PHYS 2410 (Introductory Physics 2). The elective courses\\xa0PHYS 3110 (Widely Applied Physics), PHYS 3120 (Applied Physics: Energy), and PHYS 3140 (Intermediate Lab) can be used to complete a strong preparation in applied physics. These courses are designed to make use of the concepts learned in the introductory courses to understand some modern applications with a focus on energy production and use. PHYS 3630 (Computational Physics) is another good choice for students interested in computation, or PHYS 3040 (Physics of the Human Body) for students with interest in biology or medicine. Students completing the B.A. program have an outstanding record of success in admission to medical, law, business, and education schools.

advanced research\\xa0and to receive\\xa0at graduation the honor of distinction, high distinction, or highest distinction. Entry into the program Students qualify for application to the program if they have achieved an average GPA of 3.400 in all course work prior to application to the program. Students must apply to the DMP program by April 1 of their Third Year (or equivalent). To do this, students will be asked to write a few short paragraphs in which they explain why they are interested in the program and to outline two or three topics on which they would be interested in writing. A form explaining the application essay in more detail will be available on the Religious Studies website. The applicant must obtain endorsement from a Religious Studies faculty member to apply to the program. Unless otherwise arranged, this faculty member will serve as the student’s thesis advisor. Students should contact the Religious Studies Director of Undergraduate Programs (DUP) if they need help identifying faculty members for endorsement. By the end of the first semester of the thesis-writing year, the student must obtain a second reader for the thesis from the Department as well. The DUP can also help students find a second reader if they are unable to do so on their own. DMP Requirements Completion of normal major requirements. In addition to the 30 credits required for the major, students must take the following courses. RELG 4800\\xa0-\\xa0Crafting a Research Project in Religious Studies Credits:          3 Note: In RELG 4800 students write a thesis proposal outlining the thesis’s driving questions, its methods and its sources. Students also write an annotated bibliography of works relevant to the thesis. RELG 4900\\xa0-\\xa0Distinguished Major Thesis Credits:          3 Note: RELG 4900 is an independent study in which each student works with a faculty advisor to write the Distinguished Majors Thesis. The thesis should be thirty\\xa0to fifty\\xa0pages in length. Final copies must be submitted to the faculty advisor and the second reader no later than May 1st for Spring graduation and August graduation, and December 1st for December graduation. A final copy must also be submitted to the department archives by sending it to the DUP.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Requirements for Major The department offers two concentrations: Both concentrations require courses beyond the following: RUSS 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Second-Year Russian Credits:          4 Both concentrations require the following courses to be taken beyond RUSS 2020: RUSS 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Third-Year Russian Credits:          3 RUSS 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Third-Year Russian Credits:          3 In addition to RUSS 2020, 3010, and 3020, students must complete the following for the Russian Language and Literature concentration: RUTR 3350\\xa0-\\xa0Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature Credits:          3 OR RUTR 3360\\xa0-\\xa0Twentieth Century Russian Literature Credits:          3 Additional twelve credits planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students must complete the following for the Russian and East European Studies concentration with thirty credits beyond RUSS 2020: These 30 credits include 6 credits of language study (RUSS 3010-3020 or 6 credits of another Slavic language, e.g., Polish RUTR 2460\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Russian Culture and Civilization Credits:          3 PLCP 3210\\xa0-\\xa0Russian Politics Credits:          3 HIEU 2152\\xa0-\\xa0History of the Russian Empire 1700-1917 Credits: 3 OR HIEU 2162\\xa0-\\xa0History of Russia Since 1917 Credits: 3 A course in Russian and/or Slavic folklore Three additional courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies NOTE: No more than 18 of the 30 credits (i.e., 6 of the 10 courses) may be in one department. RUTR courses offered simultaneously at the 2000 and 3000 level must be taken at the 3000 level by majors. Grading Standards: Students in the major must maintain a satisfactory grade point in major-related courses each semester. Satisfactory is defined as an average of C (i.e., 2.000), with no grade below C-. Students not maintaining this grade point are subject to discontinuation from the major. Requirements for Minor The department offers two minor programs: Russian Language, Literature, and Culture: seven courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies of at least three credits each beyond RUSS 1020 in Russian language, literature, culture and folklore. Russian and East European Studies: seven courses planned in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies of at least three credits each beyond RUSS 1020 in Russian language, literature, culture, folklore, government, history, etc., with no more than three courses in any one department. The three-course restriction does not include RUSS 2010 and 2020; therefore, as many as 5 of the 7 courses may be taken in Slavic Languages and Literatures should the student choose to take RUSS 2010 and 2020. Distinguished Majors Program Students with superior academic performance (GPA 3.500 or above in the major and 3.400 overall) are encouraged to apply to the department for admission to the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) in Russian Language, Russian Literature, or Russian and East European Studies. This program offers the exceptional student the opportunity for more rigorous and specialized work, including independent study, participation in upper-level courses, and the preparation of a senior honors thesis. Students are normally admitted to the DMP at the end of their third year of study. See the Director of Undergraduate Studies for requirements. College Language Requirement The language requirement of the College of Arts and Sciences may be satisfied in Russian by successfully completing RUSS 2020, or by presenting evidence of equivalent preparation. Any incoming student or student returning from study abroad, or study at another institution, who wishes to continue Russian must take a placement test.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites for Declaring the Major Before declaring a major in Sociology, a student must first complete two courses (six credits) in Sociology, with a grade of “C” or better in each course. SOC 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Social Theory Credits: 3 OR SOC 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Sociology Research Workshop Credits: 4 (may be used to fulfill the prerequisite requirements) NOTE: Third-year transfer students may declare a major in Sociology if they have completed two Sociology courses at their previous institution, with a grade of “C” or better in each course. Requirements for Major Four core courses are required of all sociology majors as part of the thirty credit program and\\xa0are expected to\\xa0be completed by the end of the third year. They are: SOC 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 3020\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Social Theory Credits: 3 SOC 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Sociology Research Workshop Credits: 4 SOC 3120 should be taken in the fall of the third year SOC 3130\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Social Statistics Credits: 4 NOTE: SOC 3120 is a prerequisite for SOC 3130. Majors must also complete six elective courses (18 credits). Two of these elective courses must be at the 2000 level. Four of these elective courses (12 credits) must be at the 3000 level or above, including two courses (6 credits) at the 4000 or 5000 level. Students should note that all 4000- and 5000-level courses require at least two prior Sociology courses (6 credits) as prerequisites. NOTE: Courses in the Distinguished Majors Program do not count toward the elective requirements. Only 3 credits of the following course\\xa0may be included in the thirty-hour major requirements: SOC 4970\\xa0-\\xa0Special Studies in Sociology Credits: 1 to 6 A grade of “C” or better is necessary in every course to be counted toward the major. Students receiving less than a “C” in one of the four required courses must retake the course and receive a grade of “C” or better. Students receiving less than a “C” in an elective course will be required to take another Sociology course for the major. (Elective courses where a student receives an unsatisfactory but passing grade still count toward the College’s requirement of 120 credits for graduation even though they do not count toward the major. Because the College will not give credit for taking a course twice, re-taken required Sociology courses do not count toward the 120- credit requirement.) Students are required to maintain a GPA of 2.0 or higher in Sociology courses. In addition, students may not receive grades of “C minus” or lower in three or more Sociology courses. Students who fail to meet these requirements are required to petition the Director of Undergraduate Programs for permission to remain in the major. Any such petition must include both (a) an explanation of what occurred and (b) a plan for avoiding further low grades in the future. Students who do not submit a satisfactory petition will be dropped from the major With approval of the Undergraduate Studies Committee, up to six credits (2 courses) of course work in related fields may be used to fulfill the thirty-credit requirement as elective credit (any level). These two courses should fulfill a concentration or study objective and should be completed with a “C” or better. Only sociology courses can be used to satisfy the course requirements at the 4000 or 5000 levels. NOTE: J-Term courses do not count toward the major. Exemptions and Waivers Exemption from SOC 1010 Transfer students who have transferred credits for a course in Introductory Sociology taken at another institution prior to matriculation at the University are exempt from the requirement to take SOC 1010. However, the Introductory Sociology course taken at the previous institution does not count toward the 30 credits required for the completion of the sociology major. Thus transfer students must take an additional Sociology course at any level. Exemption from SOC 3130 Students may be exempted from the requirement to take SOC 3130 - Introduction to Social Statistics, if one of the following circumstances applies: The student has completed the following two courses with a “C” or better and either (a) is double-majoring in Psychology or (b) completed those courses prior to declaring a major in sociology. PSYC 2005\\xa0-\\xa0Research Methods and Data Analysis I Credits:          3 PSYC 3006\\xa0-\\xa0Research Methods and Data Analysis II Credits:          4 The student has completed ECON 3710 with a “C” or better and either (a) is double-majoring in Economics or (b) completed that course prior to declaring a major in sociology. The student has completed one of the following courses and either (a) is double-majoring in Statistics or (b) completed that course prior to declaring a major in sociology. STAT 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Statistics for Biologists Credits: 4 STAT 2120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Statistical Analysis Credits: 4 STAT 3120\\xa0-\\xa0Introduction to Mathematical Statistics Credits: 3 Exemption from SOC 3130 does not reduce the total 30 credits required for completion of the major. Thus, exempted students must complete an additional Sociology course at any level. NOTE: Students in unusual circumstances may petition the DUP and the Undergraduate Studies Committee for an exemption from a requirement or a waiver of any departmental policy relating to the major. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that the Committee has all appropriate materials. Deferring the Declaration of Major: Before declaring a major in sociology, a student must first complete the prerequisite courses.\\xa0 (See the section above on “Requirements for the Major” for details.). Students entering their fifth semester who have not completed the prerequisites to declaring the major must defer their declaration for one semester while they complete the prerequisites.\\xa0 The Declaration of Major Deferral Form is available from the College website ( https://college.as.virginia.edu/forms ).\\xa0 On the form, list the Director of Undergraduate Programs as your “major contact” in the Department.\\xa0 You should also contact the Department’s Academic Assistant, Ms. Joyce Holleran, to let her know you plan to submit the deferral form.\\xa0 Otherwise, if you submit the form incorrectly, the Department may not know about it. Concentrations The Department offers three concentrations as options for sociology majors: “Crime, Law and Power” and “Global Economy, Organizations and Work,” and “Health and Medicine.” Although a concentration is not required, students with an interest in one of these areas may find it valuable. A concentration enables students to pursue a coherent course of study focused on a particular theme and guides them in selecting the courses that allow for an in-depth exploration of that topic. Moreover, because concentrations are noted on students’ transcripts, they signal a specific course of study to graduate programs and employers. Each concentration requires the completion of three courses (9 credits) focused on relevant topics. No more than one course (3 credits) taken outside the Department may be counted toward a concentration. To be counted toward a concentration, a course taken outside the Department must also count toward the major. Crime, Law and Power The Crime, Law and Power concentration may be of interest to students planning careers in law, criminal justice, politics, government, and related non-profit agencies. It provides students with a rigorous study of social theory and research to aid them in developing an understanding of crime and violence, law and the legal system, and legal and non-legal modes of exercising power in society. This concentration requires the completion of three\\xa0 courses (9 credits) focused on issues in crime. criminology, justice, law and the legal system, or power and authority. Students may use courses from the pre- approved list below, or may request the use of a course not listed. Any courses not on the pre-approved list, including cross-listed courses, which a student might wish to have count towards the concentration, must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Programs. The request can be shown on the Declaration Form or communicated separately, in writing, to the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Pre-Approved List SOC 2230\\xa0-\\xa0Criminology Credits: 3 SOC 4054\\xa0-\\xa0Political Sociology Credits: 3 SOC 4055\\xa0-\\xa0Law, Inequality and Social Change Credits:          3 SOC 4230\\xa0-\\xa0Deviance and Social Control Credits: 3 SOC 4260\\xa0-\\xa0Race, Crime and Punishment Credits: 3 SOC 4660\\xa0-\\xa0Sociology of Power and Authority Credits: 3 The Department will also include a current list of other relevant Arts and Sciences courses in the annually updated Undergraduate Handbook. Global Economy, Organizations and Work Requirements The Global Economy, Organizations, and Work concentration may be of interest to students planning careers in business, government, law, human resources, and market research. It provides students with the opportunity to study the economic sphere of social life from within the liberal arts and sciences, utilizing a social-science point of view. This concentration requires the completion of\\xa0three courses (9 credits) focused on issues in Global Economy, Organizations and Work by selecting at least three of the six electives allowed in the Sociology major from a list of approved courses that address markets, money, consumption, development, organizations, work and other topics in economic sociology. Students may use courses from the pre-approved list below, or may request the use of a course not listed. Any courses not on the pre-approved list, including cross-listed courses, which a student might wish to have count towards the concentration, must be approved by the Director of the Undergraduate Programs.

The Distinguished Majors Programs The Department of Sociology participates in the College’s Distinguished Majors Program (DMP). The DMP provides qualified and motivated students with the opportunity to design and carry out an original research project under the supervision of a faculty member over the course of two semesters. This effort culminates in writing an honors thesis. Eligibility for Admission to the Program • Students wishing to join the Program should have a cumulative GPA of 3.4 or higher. Students with a slightly lower GPA may be admitted, with the expectation that grades will be raised by the time of graduation (see the section on “Levels of Distinction” below). • Students must have completed SOC 3120-Sociology Research Workshop before enrolling in the Program. The Application Process Applications to the DMP should be submitted in the Spring semester of the student’s third year for participation during the fourth year. In unusual circumstances, a student may request to apply in the Fall of the third year for participation during the Spring of the third year and the Fall of the fourth year. Students who are interested in this option should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Programs. Requirements Participation in the Distinguished Majors Program requires the completion of two additional courses (six credits) beyond the 10 courses normally required for major. In the first semester of the Program, normally the Fall semester of the fourth year, students must register for SOC 4980, Distinguished Majors Thesis Research. In this course, students formulate a clear research question, design their research, prepare a detailed research proposal or thesis draft, and begin data collection. If the number of Distinguished Majors is sufficient, the 9 Department will offer a weekly Distinguished Majors seminar taught by the DUP or another faculty member. In any case, students will meet regularly with their faculty advisors. In the second semester of the Program, normally the Spring semester of the fourth year, students must register for SOC 4981, Distinguished Majors Thesis Writing. In this course, students complete data collection and analysis and write a finished thesis under the supervision of their faculty advisors. The thesis will be jointly graded by the student’s faculty advisor and a member of the Undergraduate Committee. Levels of Distinction Students who successfully complete the requirements of the DMP may receive their degrees with distinction. There are three levels of honors: distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction. The level of distinction awarded depends on: (1) the grade for the thesis, (2) overall performance in the Sociology major, and (3) overall College record. The College of Arts and Sciences requires that students completing a Distinguished Majors Program earn an overall College GPA of 3.4 or higher. Importantly, the College does not round GPAs. Any student who completes the thesis but does not have an overall GPA of 3.4 or higher will receive credit for SOC 4980 and SOC 4981, but will not be able to graduate with distinction. Requirements for Minor Academic Requirements Students must complete the following course with a grade of “C” or higher: SOC 1010\\xa0-\\xa0Introductory Sociology Credits: 3 Introduces the fundamental concepts and principles of sociology and the major subfields of the discipline. Elective Courses Minors must also complete two elective courses (6 credits) at the 4000 or 5000 level. The remaining three elective courses (9 credits) can be taken at any level. Grade Requirements All courses used to meet the 18- credit requirement must be letter-graded.\\xa0\\xa0 Courses taken on a Credit/No Credit or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis do not count toward the major. A grade of “C” or better is necessary in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students receiving less than a “C” in SOC 1010-Introductory Sociology must retake the course and receive a grade of “C” or better. \\xa0Students receiving less than a “C” in an elective course will be required to take another Sociology course to complete the minor.\\xa0 (Elective courses where a student receives an unsatisfactory but passing grade still count toward the College’s requirement of 120 credits for graduation even though they do not count toward the major. Because the College will not give credit for taking a course twice, if SOC 1010 is re-taken, the second time will not count toward the 120-credit requirement.) In addition, students are required to maintain a GPA of 2.0 or higher in Sociology.\\xa0 Students who fail to do so will be dropped from the minor. Exemptions and Waivers Exemption from SOC 1010 Transfer students who have transferred credits for a course in Introductory Sociology taken at another institution prior to matriculation at the University are exempt from the requirement to take SOC 1010-Introductory Sociology.\\xa0 However, the Introductory Sociology course taken at the previous institution does not count toward the 18 credits required for the completion of the sociology minor. Thus transfer students must take an additional sociology course at any level. Other Exemptions and Waivers Students in unusual circumstances may petition the DUP and the Undergraduate Studies Committee for an exemption from a requirement or a waiver of any departmental policy relating to the minor. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that the Committee has all appropriate materials. Prizes The Department annually awards two undergraduate prizes: The Commonwealth\\xa0Prize for the Best Undergraduate Paper in a Sociology course, and the Prize for the Outstanding Distinguished Majors Thesis.\\xa0 Faculty members nominate student papers for these awards. Facilities The department is located at Randall Hall 101, 130 Ruppel Drive, Charlottesville VA 22904. Research In addition to encouraging independent student projects, the department has occasional opportunities for students to work as paid assistants on faculty research projects. Inquiries should be addressed to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Prerequisites In order to declare a major in Spanish, a student must have completed SPAN\\xa02020 Advanced Intermediate Spanish or the equivalent, with a grade of C or better. A C- is insufficient. Students must complete SPAN 2020 at the University of Virginia or through a study abroad program recommended, not merely approved, by the department. Students who have scored a 4 on the Spanish Language Advanced Placement (AP) Exam will proceed directly to SPAN 3010. Students who have scored a 5 on the Spanish Language AP Exam may not take SPAN 3010 for credit; they are eligible to enroll in any SPAN class for which 3010 is the sole prerequisite. Students who score a 4 on the Spanish AP Literature Exam will proceed directly to SPAN 3300. Students who have scored a 5 on the Spanish AP Literature Exam may not take 3010 or 3300 for credit; they should proceed to any course for which Span 3010 or 3300 is a prerequisite. Students who have earned a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) Spanish Exam A1 or A2 may enroll in SPAN 3300. They may not take SPAN 3010 for credit. Students who have scored a 5 or 6 on the IB Spanish Exam B (High Level) should enroll in SPAN 2020. Students who have scored a 7 on the IB Spanish Exam B (High Level) should enroll in SPAN 3010. Native speakers of Spanish must consult the Director of the Undergraduate Program before taking any Spanish courses in order to determine how best to proceed. Heritage speakers will need to be assessed via SAT II, AP, or AVANT placement exam scores, but are welcome to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Program as well. Spanish Requirements for the Major in Spanish The Spanish major consists of thirty credits completed above the following course\\xa0with a grade of C or better: SPAN 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Advanced Intermediate Spanish Credits:          3 NOTE: Courses in which a student receives a C- or less will not count toward the major. As in the case of any major in the College of Arts and Sciences only courses taken for a grade will count for the major. Additionally, only courses taught in Spanish and with the “SPAN” prefix can count toward the Spanish major. When declaring the Spanish major, all students are required to choose one of the three concentrations described below ( the General Concentration, the Literature and Culture Concentration, and the Language and Linguistics Concentration ) to give structure to their Spanish studies. Students are expected to take courses in the sequence indicated below for each concentration. \\u200b The Spanish major consists of 10 different courses (30 credits). Spanish majors may not take a survey course (3400-3430) during their fourth year, unless: They are on the Language and Linguistics track OR They began upper level Spanish study late enough that it would have been impossible to have taken the survey course any earlier. Students who are placed out of the following courses must still earn 30 credits of upper-division Spanish to complete the major, substituting another language course for SPAN 3010 and another literature course for SPAN 3300: SPAN 3010\\xa0-\\xa0Finding your Voice in Spanish Credits:          3 AND/OR SPAN 3300\\xa0-\\xa0Texts and Interpretation Credits: 3 NOTE: A survey of literature and culture course (SPAN 3400-3430) may substitute for 3300 as long as it is not used to count as one of the required surveys. Students who place out of SPAN 3010 and/or 3300 must provide the department with proof of placement (e.g. copy of AP scores). Information for Native and Heritage Speakers: All students who place themselves incorrectly may lose credit for the courses in which they enroll without departmental permission. Only one conversation course may be counted toward the major. Native speakers of Spanish may not enroll in conversation courses. Heritage speakers must consult with the Director of Undergraduate Programs for permission to enroll in a conversation course. It is expected, but not required, that all Spanish majors will complete at least a summer of study-abroad. All are highly encouraged to study abroad for a semester or a year. Credit will only be granted for study completed at a program approved by the department for major or minor credit. A list of these programs is available on the department website. NOTE: Students who wish to study in a program that does not appear on the department’s list must go through the petition process administered by the International Studies Office and must also apply to the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Spanish. They must provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. Students who study in a UVA program (currently, only the program in Valencia provides 2000-4000 level courses) may count all of the courses taken abroad toward their Spanish major or minor. Students who study in an approved program in Spain or Latin America that is not run by UVA may count up to 9 credits for a semester of study abroad or 15 credits for a year of study abroad toward their Spanish major. Two non-consecutive semesters of study abroad will be treated as a continuous year abroad for the purpose of transferring credit toward the major or minor, as will any combination of a semester abroad with a summer term. Concentration in General Spanish One prerequisite and 10 additional courses.

SPAN 3010 must be taken at the University of Virginia, the U.Va. program in Valencia, or through an approved study abroad program. If the student has received a 5 in the AP Spanish Language Exam, these 3 credits need to be replaced by a language or linguistics course at the 3000 level. SPAN 3300 must be taken at the University of Virginia, the U.Va. program in Valencia, or through an approved study abroad program.\\xa0If the student has received a 5 in the AP Spanish Literature Exam, these 3 credits need to be replaced by a different literature and culture course. In order to take a 4000-level course in literature and culture or culture and civilization, a student must have previously completed at least one survey (3400s) course.\\xa0Students in the Business Spanish minor are not required to take a survey or SPAN 3300 if they take SPAN 3010 at UVA. Ideally a major will take both survey courses before advancing to the 4000-level courses in literature and culture and in culture and civilization. Please note that Spanish majors may not take literature survey courses (3400s) during their fourth year, except as described above. Note that only one conversation course will count for the major. Concentration in Literature and Culture One prerequisite and 10 additional courses.

Students wishing to study in Spain for major credit must enroll in a program approved by the department. The department operates one direct-credit program in Valencia, Spain.\\xa0 Currently, only the Valencia program offers courses at the 2000, 3000 and 4000 level.\\xa0 Students may also study in a number of other programs in Spain and Latin America that have been approved by the Spanish faculty. Consult the Director of Undergraduate Programs, or the departmental website for an up-to-date list of approved programs. Students who wish to study in a program that does not appear on this list must go through the petition process run by the International Studies Office, and must apply to the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Spanish.\\xa0 They must provide a compelling academic reason for studying in a non-approved program. For information about how to count study-abroad credit toward the major in Spanish, please consult the sections on the major above. Independent Study Independent study with a faculty advisor is available to advanced students who wish to pursue specific areas in depth that are not included in the regular curriculum. All of these courses must be taught in Spanish\\xa0and must have the “SPAN” prefix—as noted above, only courses taught in Spanish and with the “SPAN” prefix can count toward the Spanish major, the Spanish minor, and the Business Spanish minor. For an independent study course to count for the Spanish major it must be taken for a grade. Distinguished Majors Program Spanish majors of exceptional ability and dedication are encouraged to enroll in the Distinguished Major Program. Like other Spanish majors, the DMPs are required to take ten courses (30 credits) at the 3000-level or above. However, three of these courses must be 4000-level seminars or, with the approval of the DMP Coordinator, 5000-level courses. In addition to the ten courses (30 credit hours) required of all majors, DMPs take two additional courses (6 hours) devoted to researching and writing a thesis in Spanish. In the fall semester of their 4th year, DMPs enroll in Span 4890, “Distinguished Major Colloquium” (a 3-credit credit/no credit course), and meet regularly with the Coordinator to discuss research strategies and set intermediate goals. In the second semester of their 4th year, DMPs enroll in Span 4989, “Distinguished Major Thesis” (3 credits, grade option) and meet regularly with a faculty thesis adviser. DMPs present their research at a departmental colloquium in the spring of their final year. A departmental committee determines different levels of distinction (Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction), based on the quality of the student’s thesis, the student’s overall work in the major field of study, and the student’s overall college record (a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 is required). SPAN 4989\\xa0-\\xa0Distinguished Major in Spanish Thesis Credits: 3 Language Requirement SPAN 1010 and 1020 are courses reserved exclusively for true beginners, students who have never studied Spanish before entering UVA. Students who have studied Spanish prior to coming to UVA and who wish to continue in Spanish will be placed according to scores obtained on the College Entrance Examination Board SAT II tests, the AP Exam, the IB (high level) exam, or the UVa Spanish placement exam. The sequence of courses, depending on the level at which the student begins, is as follows: SPAN 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020; or SPAN 1060, 2010, 2020; or SPAN 2010, 2020; or SPAN 2020. The sequence must be followed to complete the language requirement. Once students begin the sequence of courses, they cannot skip any course in the sequence. Students are not permitted to self-place in a language course. Students who place themselves incorrectly will receive an F for the courses in which they enroll without permission. SPAN 1010 is offered in Fall only and SPAN 1020 is offered in Spring only. All Spanish courses to be counted toward the language requirement must be taken at UVA or at a UVA approved study abroad program. Major in Latin-American Studies For major and minor requirements see the section on Latin American Studies.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: College of Arts & Sciences: Degree Programs The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics provides students with a deep grounding in the field of statistics, both applications and theory. A deep understanding of data analysis and statistics plays a critical role in many aspects of modern society.\\xa0 Students completing this major will have a wide range of options available upon graduation. Students completing the B.S. in Statistics will be well prepared to design experimental studies, clean and analyze data, modify existing statistical methods guided by underlying theory, and effectively communicate results to stakeholders. They will also be well prepared to enter graduate programs (M.S. or Ph.D.) in statistics and related fields.\\xa0 With a modest amount of advance planning students are able to complete an M.S. in Statistics at UVa with one additional year of study. Students interested in the B.S./M.S. program should visit the Department of Statistics website. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Program Requirements The BS in Statistics requires nine core courses and six restricted elective courses. In total the BS in Statistics requires 46\\xa0credit hours, plus prerequisite courses. There are two lists of restricted elective courses, those that focus on data analysis and those that are more computational.

Description of Captsone For the capstone, students will work in teams of 3 or 4 to complete an extensive data analysis project. The students and capstone faculty will work collaboratively to develop a hands-on project for each team to demonstrate knowledge and skill in data analysis, interpretation, and communication. Each project will require the team to determine the nature of the questions of interest; prepare data for analysis; select and perform the appropriate analysis; determine conclusions; and present the results. The capstone project will provide an opportunity to observe how students work through all aspects of a statistical analysis. Students will be guided and evaluated by the capstone faculty. The capstone experience will culminate with the submission of a final report and a formal presentation. If a student fails the capstone course, the Director of Undergraduate Programs will meet with the student to determine a set of revisions and/or alternative academic activities to complete their project. A student who fails to complete their project may retake the course in a subsequent semester.

See https://www.scps.virginia.edu/bachelors-in-health-sciences-management/curriculum/ for degree requirements. Students admitted to the BPHM degree program are generally expected to complete all remaining degree requirements at the University. \\xa0Those who matriculated with fewer than 60 transfer credits and who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at UVA must confirm the transferability of course work in advance with appropriate SCPS staff. It is the student’s responsibility to provide an official transcript to the SCPS Central Admission Office as soon as outside course work is completed and to request that the additional transfer credits be posted to their official UVA record. Any transferable course work from other institutions must be completed prior to the semester in which the student enrolls in Capstone I (PSHM 4900).\\xa0 Students are expected to have successfully completed at least 105 credits toward the BPHM degree in order to enroll in Capstone I. Time to Degree Students will generally enroll in\\xa06 credit\\xa0hours per\\xa0term (fall, spring, and summer).\\xa0They must complete the program in 21 terms (7 years). Academic Regulations and Options All students are subject to the academic policies specified in the section titled “University Regulations”. The following academic requirements and options apply to students in the BPHM program along with regulations listed in this Record under SCPS Academic Policies, Rules, and Regulations. Add/Drop Regulations Students may add courses, with instructor and academic advisor\\xa0permission, until the published deadline for the semester. The add deadline is also the last day to change the grading option for courses. Students may drop courses without penalty until the published drop deadline. Students who withdraw from an individual course or all courses after the semester has begun will be charged tuition for the semester on a prorated scale. Students are\\xa0responsible for the accuracy of\\xa0their course enrollment record; changes to course enrollment may be made online through the Student Center in SIS, before the published deadlines. Advising Providing advising related to\\xa0academic matters and student services is an important element of the BPHM degree program. All students receive individual academic advising from prior to their first term of enrollment in BPHM.\\xa0Students are responsible for consulting with their advisors each semester before enrolling in courses. Academic advisors work closely with the student to plan the program of study, to monitor the student’s progress, and provide advice on matters pertaining to\\xa0the\\xa0program,\\xa0academic policies, and procedures. Students and advisors should use the student’s UVA unofficial advising transcript to help monitor progress toward degree requirements. The academic advisor may also assist the student in identifying a faculty mentor to work with the student on the Capstone Project that is undertaken near the completion of the BPHM degree program. A student who wishes to take a non-BPHM UVA course for credit or a leave of absence from the program must secure approval from the academic advisor, as well as the BPHM Director. Course Load With a commitment to student success, BPHM advisors and/or administrators recommend appropriate course loads each semester during advising conversations. BPHM generally\\xa0advises students to enroll in no more than 6 semester credits in their first semester in the program and during the semesters in which they are enrolled in Capstone II. However, the program provides flexibility that acknowledges a student’s individual circumstances, needs, and academic progress. Students who wish to register for more than 9 credits in a given term must acquire advisor and program director permission. Students who plan to apply for financial aid through the University need to carry a minimum of six credits per semester in order to be eligible for financial aid through the University. These students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine what the specific requirements are for the various types of aid they wish to receive.\\xa0 Visit: www. sfs.virginia.edu Credit/No Credit Option Students may choose a credit/no credit (CR/NC) grading option up until the add deadline for courses. Instructors have the right to prohibit students from taking courses on a CR/NC basis. The Major Core Requirement courses and Capstone I and II courses must be graded and may not be taken CR/NC. BPHM\\xa0students may take no more than one course per semester on a CR/NC basis, and a maximum of nine credits may be taken on a CR/NC basis during a student’s tenure in the BPHM\\xa0program.\\xa0Due to the global pandemic, grades of CR/GC/NC earned during the spring 2020, fall 2020, J-term 2021, spring 2021, and summer 2021 terms do not count against the maximum number of credits that may be earned on a CR/NC basis that is imposed by schools and departments. Honor System The Honor System is one of the University’s oldest and most venerated traditions. Based on the fundamental assumption that anyone who enrolls at the University subscribes to a code of ethics forbidding lying, cheating, and stealing, the Honor System allows students the kind of personal freedom possible only in an environment where respect and trust are assumed. For nearly 180 years, students have administered this system at the University. While the Honor System applies to students enrolled on- and off-Grounds through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, some procedures for administration of the system to continuing and professional studies students differ from those governing on-Grounds full time students. Off-Grounds students should consult the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website www.scps.virginia.edu or visit The Honor Committee website www.virginia.edu/honor for a copy of the by-laws under Governing Documents. Leaves of Absence Students who wish to take a voluntary leave of absence for either a semester or a calendar year must consult with the BPHM Director and apply for such leave through their Student Center in the Student Information System (SIS). The School of Continuing and Professional Studies requires students on leave to apply for readmission at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the semester in which they intend to reenroll. Academic Warning and Suspension Students may be placed on academic warning, with a notation appearing on their transcripts, if they: Fail to earn a minimum grade point average of 1.800 for the semester; Fail to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0; Earn more than one grade below C- in any given semester; Earn a grade below D in any course during two consecutive semesters Students on academic\\xa0warning are expected to meet with their academic advisors prior to the end of the add/drop period so they may remedy their academic shortcoming(s). Students on academic warning who withdraw or take leaves of absence are eligible to return but do so on academic\\xa0warning\\xa0and are subject to suspension if they do not attain good standing within the first semester of their return. Suspension involves enforced withdrawal from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies.\\xa0A student placed on academic warning\\xa0in any semester may be suspended if he or she does not regain good standing at the end of the next semester.\\xa0 A student who has been suspended may apply for readmission after one regular semester or one calendar year has elapsed since the date of suspension. The BPHM Director determines the amount of lapsed time before readmission.\\xa0If readmitted, the student will remain on academic warning and will be suspended again if not in good standing.\\xa0While on suspension, students may not earn credits to advance their progress toward the BPHM degree. Readmission Students who do not enroll at the University for more than two semesters and who are not on an approved leave of absence will be required to apply for readmission. Students returning from suspension will also be required to apply for readmission. Application for readmission must be made to the BPHM Director at least 30 days in advance of the next University registration period. Students should include with their applications a statement that (1) addresses their readiness to return to the program in light of any serious difficulties during their most recent enrollment (e.g., financial, medical, or personal hardship) and (2) outlines those courses that the student will take over the remaining semesters to qualify for a degree. Refunds The refund schedule for classes offered through the Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management is governed by the University’s refund schedule. For more information, please visit Student Financial Services www.sfs.virginia.edu/ Repeated Courses In accordance with the University policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once.\\xa0 The two courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. Satisfactory Academic Performance Students admitted to the BPHM program are expected to complete all degree requirements within seven years (i.e., twenty-one consecutive semesters including fall, spring, and summer) of matriculation into the program. Leaves of absence and suspensions do not change the requirement to complete all degree requirements within these parameters. All BPHM students are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. To that end, each student’s academic standing is reviewed at the conclusion of each semester. Withdrawal The following policies govern withdrawal from the BPHM program as well as from individual courses: Course Withdrawal With the instructor’s permission, BPHM students may withdraw from a course with a grade of W, up to the midpoint of the course.\\xa0After this cutoff, students must complete the course. With an endorsement from the professor, the BPHM Director will consider a student’s petition to withdraw from a course after the deadline because of compelling and highly unusual circumstances. Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure are subject to a failing grade. Enforced Withdrawal The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may compel a student to withdraw from the BPHM program for good cause. A student who is asked to withdraw from the program may petition the dean for readmission after one calendar year. Medical Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the BPHM program for reasons of health with the approval of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and BPHM Director. A notation of Medical Withdrawal will appear on the student’s transcript. Voluntary Withdrawal A BPHM student who wishes to withdraw from the program must formally withdraw from the University. The student is encouraged to meet first with the academic advisor of record; the student must meet with the BPHM Director for an exit interview. Leaving the program without following the requisite process results in the student’s receiving a grade of F in all courses that he or she fails to complete. A student who withdraws from the University voluntarily has the notation “Withdrawn [date]” recorded on his or her permanent academic record. Financial Aid BPHM students interested in applying for financial aid should consult the information provided by the office of Student Financial Services www. sfs.virginia.edu In general, requests for consideration of aid require that the student file the federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the UVA Undergraduate Financial Aid Application. Minimum semester credit requirements for federal financial aid may be greater than those required by the degree program. Information about the FAFSA can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov ; information about the Office of Financial Aid is available at www. sfs.virginia.edu or by calling (434) 982-6000. Orientation Orientation for new students is a key to success in the BPHM program. New students are required to participate in all scheduled BPHM orientation activities. Prior to the beginning of classes, students are provided with information about registration, University e-mail accounts, student services, as well as academic advising. Honors Final Honors - Degrees with distinction, with high distinction, and with highest distinction are awarded to BPHM students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.400, 3.600, and 3.800, respectively, on all UVA course work. Curriculum The BPHM curriculum has five components: upper-division Humanities and Social Sciences courses, Major Core Requirements, Approved Health Sciences Management Electives, and\\xa0two Capstone Project courses. Courses listed below are subject\\xa0to possible\\xa0change as the curriculum is further developed.

Students will be required to first complete Capstone I: Development of the Health Sciences Management Project (3 credits) . Students will develop a thoughtful, well-organized and clearly written proposal of their individual Capstone Project. Before registering for Capstone I: Development of the Health Sciences Management Project , students must have completed most of their other major core requirements (24 credits), most of their upper-division humanities/social sciences requirements (12 credits) and most of their other approved health sciences management electives (9 credits), have removed all incompletes, and be in good academic standing, that is, not to\\xa0be on academic warning. Upon successful completion of the Capstone I course, students will be registered for Capstone II: Health Sciences Management Project Implementation (3 credits), in which students pursue independent research into and write a substantial paper that relfects a deep understanding of their topic as proposed in Capstone I. Students will present their research to an audience of faculty, students and others at the end of the semester.\\xa0Students must receive a grade of C or higher in both Capstone Project courses to complete the BPHM degree. Enrollment in the Capstone II course should occur in the last term prior to graduation except with prior approval by the program director.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Continuing and Professional Studies: Degree Programs The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) degree program is tailored to adults who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree through part-time study. Approved in 1999 by the Board of Visitors and the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the B.I.S. program makes it possible for students with earned college credits to complete undergraduate degrees. The B.I.S. program offers a challenging and intellectually stimulating curriculum with evening,\\xa0weekend and online\\xa0courses drawn from those already offered at the University or approved by University faculty specifically for this degree program. The program maintains a full course schedule in the summer, fall, and spring semesters; classes are primarly offered in an online synchronous format with some hybrid and asynchronous opportunities. The interdisciplinary curriculum of the B.I.S. program includes upper-level courses in academic fields that bring together both the range of learning implied by a liberal arts degree and the depth of knowledge associated with study at an advanced undergraduate level. The program emphasizes critical thinking, clear articulation of ideas, and the habits of individual and collective learning that develop and sustain life-long learners. Interdisciplinary Liberal Studies Seminars and Conduct of Inquiry courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences unique to the program are required of all students. Students will pursue an academic concentration within the degree program and must complete Capstone Project I and Capstone Project II in which they do independent research into a topic of their choice, based on their academic, professional, or personal interests or some combination of these, and write a substantial paper that reflects the depth and breadth of their educational experience. Students have seven years (twenty-one semesters, including fall, spring, and summer) after admission to the program to complete all requirements for the B.I.S. degree B.I.S. students are governed by the student-run Honor System and the Standards of Conduct described in the University Regulations section of the University Record, subject to revision by authorized University offices. Policies and procedures can be obtained from the University Honor Committee and the University Judiciary Committee. Academic policies and regulations of the B.I.S. program are under the aegis of\\xa0the Curriculum and Course Review Committee, the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and the B.I.S. Director. To learn more about this undergraduate degree program, or to obtain application information, individuals should contact: B.I.S. Degree Program University of Virginia School of Continuing and Professional Studies P.O. Box 400764 Charlottesville, VA 22904-4764 800-346-3882 http://www.scps.virginia.edu Requirements for Degree Admission The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree program is intended for adults who have earned 36-60 transferable semester credits from one or more regionally accredited colleges or universities, and are prepared to enter a rigorous program of study. Applicants must present a minimum of 36 transferable credits, to include sufficient course work to satisfy (a) the full English Composition requirement at their previous institution and (b) at least 12 additional credits toward the Liberal Studies Core general education requirement. Any remaining Liberal Studies Core general education requirements not satisfied upon admission must be completed with a C or better, whether they are taken at UVA or transferred from another institution. Applicants must complete a formal application for admission, be in good academic and social standing, and have earned at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average at the institution they attended most recently. Additionally, applicants who have previously attended the University of Virginia must be in good financial, academic, and social standing with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Prospective students apply through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies’ admission process rather than through the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Although applicants submit transcripts from all previously attended colleges as part of their application, prospective students are strongly encouraged to upload their unofficial transcripts for a preliminary evaluation and feedback prior to beginning the application.\\xa0 A consultation with a B.I.S. representative is a recommended component of the application process. \\xa0Admitted students must provide official transcripts from all previously attended colleges, including final grades for any pending course work. Official transcript must be sent directly from the institution or its clearinghouse to the SCPS Central Admission Office. Failure to provide official transcripts by the deadline will result in an enrollment block on the student’s account which will prevent course registration in subsequent academic terms. Degree Requirements To be awarded the B.I.S. degree, students must present 120 approved semester credits, including at least 60 credits earned at the University of Virginia, and successfully complete the B.I.S. curriculum, as outlined below in “Curriculum.” At least 51 credits taken at the University must have been completed on a graded (A+ to D-) basis. Students must have earned a 2.000 cumulative grade point average on all work taken at the University. Students are subject to the degree and curricular requirements in effect for the semester in which they were admitted to the B.I.S. program. Students who matriculated with fewer than 60 transfer credits and who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at UVA must confirm the transferability of course work in advance with appropriate SCPS staff. It is the student’s responsibility to provide an official transcript to the SCPS Central Admission Office as soon as outside course work is completed and to request that the additional transfer credits be posted to their official UVA record. After ordering the official transcript, the student must submit the Request for Post-Matriculation Transfer of Credit form, which is linked on the SCPS website. Any transferable course work from other institutions must be completed prior to the semester in which the student enrolls in Capstone I (ISCP 3991).\\xa0 Students are expected to have successfully completed at least 105 credits toward the B.I.S. degree in order to enroll in Capstone I. Transfer of Credit The University grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended concentration and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. Credits eligible for transfer must have been earned with at least a “C” grade (2.0 or better) and in courses comparable in content and rigor to those offered at the University of Virginia. Credits earned in a pass/fail grading system will only be eligible for transfer if certification is provided that the student earned at least a “C” average. Only credits transfer; grades do not transfer. Students receive no more, and may receive fewer, than the number of credits earned at the host institutions. No more than 60 semester credits, or half the number of credits required for graduation, transfer from a combination of approved testing programs (Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate) and course credits. Quarter and trimester credits are converted to semester credits. The general University policy on accepting credits from foreign institutions will apply. Credit for College Level Examination Placement credits, life experience credits, correspondence credits, military education credits, Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate testing is awarded according to guidelines used in the College of Arts and Sciences. Transfer credit is generally not granted for credit passed elsewhere by re-examination. Occasionally, credits earned through special programs such as Prior Learning Activities for Credit Evaluation (PLACE) at Northern Virginia Community College are considered. Courses required for a B.I.S. concentration do not transfer from other institutions into the B.I.S. degree. Credits earned in courses taken at other institutions while the student is enrolled in the B.I.S. program are only eligible for transfer if the student receives permission from B.I.S. administration before enrolling in the course(s). Students who have completed courses with the FBI National Academy or the National Criminal Justice Command College should consult with SCPS admissions staff to determine how those credits can be applicable to B.I.S. course requirements. The Liberal Studies Core The Liberal Studies Core demonstrates that students have studied a broad range of academic disciplines and are prepared for study at a more advanced level in a liberal arts program. Students must satisfy the English Composition requirement, generally with six semester credits. With sufficient supporting evidence, it may be possible for a student to satisfy this requirement with fewer than six credits. Upon admission to B.I.S., students must have satisfied the English Composition requirement, and at least twelve credits toward the Liberal Studies Core outlined below. Humanities: at least six semester credits earned in art history, selected architectural history courses, classics, literature, drama, film studies, fine arts, music (exclusive of performance), philosophy, political theory, religious studies, or western or eastern civilization or similar courses. Social Sciences: at least six semester credits earned in anthropology, economics, government and foreign affairs (except political theory), history (exclusive of western, eastern, or other civilization courses, which are considered humanities courses), psychology, or sociology. Math and/or Natural Science: at least eight semester credits earned in approved math, astronomy, biology, chemistry, environmental science, or physics. Generally, only courses comparable to those that satisfy an area requirement for the College of Arts and Sciences satisfy the Core. Additional Liberal Arts: at least ten semester credits in coursework that could satisfy the humanities, social sciences, math and/or natural science requirements. Any remaining Liberal Studies Core general education requirements not satisfied upon admission must be completed with a C or better, whether they are taken at UVA or transferred from another institution. Students should prioritize completion of any remaining general education requirements within their first four terms of enrollment in B.I.S. Business Concentration Prerequisites In order to declare a business concentration, students should have completed the following prerequisites or equivalents (generally before admission to the B.I.S. program). The University designations are listed first, followed by the Virginia Community College designations in parenthesis. Students should complete outstanding prerequisites before registering for upper division Business classes. COMM 2010: Introduction to Financial Accounting - 3 credits (ACC 211) ECON 2010: Principles of Economics: Microeconomics - 3 credits (ECO 202) ECON 2020: Principles of Economics: Macroeconomics - 3 credits (ECO 201) STAT 1100 or 1120: Introduction to Statistics - 3 credits (MTH 155 or 245) Courses presented to fulfill the prerequisites should be substantially similar in focus, content and objectives to these courses as they are described in the current University of Virginia Undergraduate Record . Psychology Concentration Prerequisites In order to declare a psychology concentration, students should have completed the following prerequisite or its equivalent. The University designation is listed first, followed by the Virginia Community College designation in parenthesis. Students should complete outstanding prerequisites before registering for upper division Psychology classes. PSYC 1010: Introduction to Psychology – 3 credits (PSY 200 or 201) Computer Competency Expectation While the B.I.S. program does not have a formal computer competency requirement, all students are responsible for gaining the computer skills needed to perform well in any B.I.S. course. Those skills include the following: e-mail; word processing; use of the Internet, especially for academic research and participation in online classes; and use of Excel and PowerPoint in some courses (these expectations will be noted on specific course syllabi). The B.I.S. staff can provide suggestions for course work that can help strengthen these computer skills prior to applying to the program. Access to a high-speed Internet connection is strongly recommended and will optimize access to the UVA web learning tools including electronic course materials, the UVA libraries,\\xa0and UVA learning management systems. Demonstrating Success in B.I.S. To continue in the program, all B.I.S. students must maintain good financial and social standing at the University and complete the following academic requirements by the end of the fourth consecutive semester after B.I.S. matriculation. In certain circumstances, extensions of the first four term requirements may be extended to students by permission of the B.I.S. program. B.I.S. students are required to take ISLS 3000:\\xa0Transformations: Reading, Thinking, and Communicating in the Liberal Arts during their first semester in the program and one additional 3000-level ISLS course within the first four academic terms.\\xa0Students must obtain a grade of C or better in each of these courses to satisfy the requirement. B.I.S. students are required to take one Conduct of Inquiry course in the Social Sciences (ISIN 4510) and one Conduct of Inquiry course in the Humanities (ISIN 4520). It is strongly suggested that students complete these courses within the first four academic terms. Students must obtain a grade of C or better in each of these courses to satisfy the requirement. Either ISIN 4510 or ISIN 4520 must be completed prior to taking Capstone I. Cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 on all UVA course work (including courses completed prior to B.I.S. matriculation). A detailed concentration proposal if pursuing an Individualized Concentration (due by the time the student completes 12 credits in the B.I.S. program). Earn a minimum of 12 credits toward the B.I.S. degree after admission to the program. Satisfy any Liberal Studies Core general education requirements missing upon B.I.S. admission. Students who are unable to satisfy these requirements by the end of the fourth consecutive semester after B.I.S. matriculation may be required to leave the program or may be placed on Academic Warning. A student who is asked to withdraw from the program may, after waiting one full year, petition to re-apply. Academic Regulations and Options All students are subject to the academic policies specified in the section titled “University Regulations.” The following academic requirements and options apply to students in the\\xa0B.I.S. program along with regulations listed in this Record under SCPS Academic Policies, Rules, and Regulations. Students who have questions about any such policies should contact their academic advisor. Add/Drop Regulations Students may add courses, with instructor and academic advisor\\xa0permission, until the published deadline for the semester. The add deadline is also the last day to change the grading option for courses. Students may drop courses without penalty until the published drop deadline. Students who withdraw from an individual course or all courses after the semester has begun will be charged tuition for the semester on a prorated scale. To enroll in courses restricted by permission of the instructor, a student must submit to the B.I.S. office a course action form signed by the instructor. An e-mail communication directly from the instructor may substitute. Students are\\xa0responsible for the accuracy of\\xa0their course enrollment record; changes to course enrollment may be made online, through the Student Center in SIS, before the published deadlines. Advising Providing advice related to academic matters and student services is an important element of the B.I.S. degree program. All students receive individual academic advising prior to their first term of enrollment in B.I.S., and will receive a faculty advisor before their second term of enrollment. Students are responsible for consulting with their advisors each semester before enrolling in courses. Academic advisors work closely with the student to plan the program of study, to monitor the student’s progress, and provide advice on matters pertaining to B.I.S. academic policies and procedures. Students and advisors should use the student’s unofficial transcript to help monitor progress toward fulfilling degree requirements. The academic advisor may also assist the student with planning their Capstone Project. A student who wishes to take a non-B.I.S. UVA course for credit, more than nine credits in a semester, or a leave of absence from the program must secure approval from the academic advisor and the B.I.S. Director. Students must complete a Leave of Absence form, which is provided in SIS. Auditing A student enrolled in the B.I.S. program may audit B.I.S. program courses with the permission of the course instructor. Courses successfully completed on an audit basis have the AU recorded as the grade on the academic record. Because audited courses earn no credits or grade points, they are not applicable to the B.I.S. degree. The course instructor is the sole determinant of whether a student can take the course on an audit basis. The approved B.I.S. tuition and fee rates apply to audited courses, and students auditing courses are expected to meet all academic requirements of the course. Audited courses do not apply toward minimum or maximum credits when calculating course loads. Course Load With a commitment to student success, B.I.S. advisors and/or administrators recommend appropriate course loads each semester during advising conversations.\\xa0 B.I.S. generally advises students to enroll in no more than 6 semester credits in their first semester in the program and during the semesters in which they are enrolled in Capstone II. However, the program provides flexibility that acknowledges a student’s individual circumstances, needs, and academic progress. Students who wish to register for more than 9 credits in a given term must acquire advisor permission. Students who plan to apply for financial aid through the University need to carry a minimum of six credits per semester to be eligible for financial aid through the University. These students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine what the specific requirements are for the various types of aid they wish to receive. http://sfs.virginia.edu Credit/No Credit Option Students may choose a credit/no credit (CR/NC) grading option up until the add deadline for courses. Instructors have the right to prohibit students from taking courses on a CR/NC basis. The required Liberal Studies Seminars, Conduct of Inquiry courses, concentration courses, Capstone Project I, Capstone Project II, and any courses used to satisfy Liberal Studies Core general education requirements must be graded and may not be taken CR/NC. B.I.S. students may take no more than one course per semester on a CR/NC basis, and a maximum of nine credits may be taken on a CR/NC basis during a student’s tenure in the B.I.S. program. Due to the global pandemic, grades of CR/GC/NC earned during the spring 2020, fall 2020, J-term 2021, spring 2021, and summer 2021 terms do not count against the maximum number of credits that may be earned on a CR/NC basis that is imposed by schools and departments. Honor System The Honor System is one of the University’s oldest and most venerated traditions. Based on the fundamental assumption that anyone who enrolls at the University subscribes to a code of ethics forbidding lying, cheating, and stealing, the Honor System allows students the kind of personal freedom possible only in an environment where respect and trust are assumed. For nearly 180 years, students have administered this system at the University. While the Honor System applies to students enrolled on- and off-Grounds through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, some procedures for administration of the system to continuing and professional studies students differ from those governing on-Grounds full time students. Off-Grounds students should consult the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website www.scps.virginia.edu or visit The Honor Committee website www.virginia.edu/honor for a copy of the by-laws under Governing Documents. Independent Study A\\xa0 B.I.S. student who wishes to receive degree credit for an independent study must submit, with a faculty member’s endorsement, a proposed plan of study to include a course syllabus. This proposal must be approved by the B.I.S. Director no later than the mid-point of the semester prior to the semester in which the proposed independent study is to be undertaken. The student should have taken at least one course with that professor prior to submitting a proposal. In most circumstances, a maximum of three credits of independent study after matriculation to the program may be counted toward the B.I.S. degree. Approval of Independent Studies is at the discretion of the B.I.S. Director. Students are strongly encouraged to discuss their independent study idea with the Director before preparing a proposal. Intra-University Transfer B.I.S. students, as degree candidates at the University of Virginia, can apply for transfer to other schools of the University through the Intra-University Transfer process. Each school establishes its own criteria and procedures, and students in all schools are subject to them. Students interested in Intra-University Transfer are to discuss their intentions and reasons with their academic advisor and with the B.I.S. Director; contact the appropriate committee of the school to which the student seeks transfer in order to learn what is required; if the student is prepared to apply for transfer, write to the B.I.S. Director to state those intentions; follow that particular school’s steps to apply for transfer; and continue to function as a B.I.S. student until such time as a transfer application may be accepted and matriculation in a new degree program commences. Leaves of Absence A student who wishes to take a one-semester leave of absence must complete and submit a Leave of Absence request form in SIS. Students on approved leaves of absence are not required to apply for readmission to the B.I.S. program prior to their return, but should notify B.I.S. staff of their intended return at least 30 days before the open registration date for that semester. The University policy on Leaves of Absence may be found at http://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-011 . Minimum Grades The following courses must be completed with a grade of C or better: ISLS 3000; one additional 3000-level\\xa0Liberal Studies Seminar;\\xa0ISIN 4510; ISIN 4520; Capstone Project I and Capstone Project II, and any courses taken to satisfy Liberal Studies Core general education requirements. Courses taken to meet the concentration requirements must be completed with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Non-B.I.S. Courses Students enrolled in the B.I.S. program normally will complete their degree requirements by taking B.I.S. courses. Beginning with the second semester of B.I.S. enrollment, a student may be granted permission to take a course in another school or college of the University and to have that course count toward B.I.S. degree requirements. Before registering for any course outside SCPS, B.I.S. students must secure permission from the instructor and forward that to the B.I.S. Director for final approval. If advance approval is not obtained, non-B.I.S. courses may not be applied toward degree requirements. Students may apply a maximum of 18 credits of non-B.I.S. UVA courses to the B.I.S. degree after enrolling in the program. B.I.S. students pursuing an Individualized Concentration may be granted permission to take additional non-B.I.S. UVA courses for the concentration (3000 level and above) and/or for degree electives after enrolling in the B.I.S. program. Academic Warning\\xa0and Suspension Students may be placed on academic warning, with a notation appearing on their transcripts, if they: Fail to earn a minimum grade point average of 1.800 for the semester; Fail to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.000; Earn more than one grade below C- in any given semester; Earn a grade below D in any course during two consecutive semesters. Students on academic warning must meet with their academic advisors prior to the end of the add/drop period so they may remedy their academic shortcoming(s). Students on academic warning who withdraw or take leaves of absence are eligible to return but do so on academic warning and are subject to suspension if they do not attain good standing within the first semester of their return. Academic suspension involves enforced withdrawal from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies.\\xa0A student placed on academic warning in any semester may be suspended if they do\\xa0not regain good standing at the end of the next semester.\\xa0A student who has been suspended may apply for readmission after one regular semester has elapsed since the suspension date. If readmitted, the student will remain on academic warning\\xa0and will be suspended again if not in good standing. Readmission Students who do not enroll at the University for more than two semesters, and who are not on an approved Leave of Absence, may be required to apply for readmission. Application for readmission must be made to the B.I.S. Director at least 30 days before the open registration date for the upcoming semester. Students should include with their applications a statement that (1) addresses their readiness to return to the program in light of any serious difficulties during their most recent enrollment (e.g., financial, medical, or personal hardship) and (2) outlines those courses that the student will take over the remaining semesters to qualify for a degree. In some circumstances, a student may be asked to formally reapply to the program by the published admission deadlines. Refunds The refund schedule for classes offered through the Bachelor of\\xa0Interdisciplinary Studies program is governed by the University’s refund schedule. For more information, please visit Student Financial Services http://sfs.virginia.edu Repeated Courses In accordance with the University Policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once.\\xa0 The two courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. Requests for Exceptions and Appeals Students who believe they should be exempted from prerequisite courses or other B.I.S. requirements or regulations may petition for an exception to the B.I.S. Director after they have consulted with their academic advisor. Satisfactory Academic Performance Students admitted to the B.I.S. program are expected to complete all degree requirements within seven years (i.e., twenty-one consecutive semesters including fall, spring, and summer) of matriculation into the program. Leaves of absence and suspensions do not change the requirement to complete all degree requirements within these parameters. All B.I.S. students are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. To that end, each student’s academic standing is reviewed at the conclusion of each semester. Withdrawal The following policies govern withdrawal from the B.I.S. program as well as from individual courses: Course Withdrawal With the instructor’s permission, B.I.S. students may withdraw from a course with a grade of W, up to the midpoint of the course.\\xa0After this cutoff, students must complete the course. With an endorsement from the professor, the B.I.S. Director will consider a student’s petition to withdraw from a course after the deadline because of compelling and highly unusual circumstances. Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure are subject to a failing grade. Enforced Withdrawal The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may compel a student to withdraw from the B.I.S. program for good cause. A student asked to withdraw from the program may petition the Dean for readmission after one calendar year. Medical Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the B.I.S. program for reasons of health with the approval of the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and B.I.S. Director. A notation of Medical Withdrawal will appear on the student’s transcript. Voluntary Withdrawal A B.I.S. student who wishes to withdraw from the program must formally withdraw from the University. The student is encouraged to meet first with the academic advisor of record; the student must meet with the B.I.S. Director for an exit interview, fill out the appropriate paperwork, and turn in the University identification card. Leaving the program without following the requisite process results in the student’s receiving a grade of F in all courses that he or she fails to complete. A student who withdraws from the University voluntarily has the notation “Withdrawn [date]” recorded on his or her permanent academic record. Financial Aid B.I.S. students interested in applying for financial aid should consult the information provided by the office of Student Financial Services http://sfs.virginia.edu In general, requests for consideration of aid require that the student file the federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the UVA Undergraduate Financial Aid Application. Minimum semester credit requirements for federal financial aid may be greater than those required by the degree program. Information about the FAFSA can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov ; information about the Office of Financial Aid is available at http://sfs.virginia.edu or by calling (434) 982-6000 Orientation Orientation for new students is a key to success in the B.I.S. program. New students must participate in all scheduled B.I.S. orientation activities, during which they are provided information about registration, University e-mail accounts, student services, academic advising and student groups. Student Activities and Services B.I.S. students have\\xa0access to intramural and recreation activities and facilities, University Career Services, electronic mail, the Information Technology Center and its services, and other non-curricular activities. Peer Mentor Program The Peer Mentor Program is a student-run program that helps introduce and integrate new students into B.I.S. and the wider UVA community by providing support and information from a student perspective. Peer Mentors complement the faculty advisor and the B.I.S. staff in offering a type of support for students that can be most effectively provided by peers, but they do not substitute as academic advisors. Prospective Peer Mentors must have completed three semesters or 18 hours in the Program. Awards,\\xa0Honors and Scholarships Alpha Sigma Lambda The University of Virginia hosts the Beta Iota Sigma chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda, a national academic honor society for adult students in baccalaureate degree programs. The top 20% of B.I.S. students who have completed at least twenty-four credits at UVA since B.I.S. matriculation with a cumulative grade point average of 3.2 or higher are eligible to be considered for membership in the society. The cumulative grade point average will be calculated at the conclusion of the fall semester, with induction occurring in spring. Final Honors Degrees with distinction, with high distinction, and with highest distinction are awarded to B.I.S. students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.400, 3.600, and 3.800, respectively, on all UVA course work. Osher Reentry Scholarship To be eligible for consideration in the Fall and Spring semesters, reentry students applying for this scholarship in B.I.S. must be pursuing their first baccalaureate degree, must demonstrate financial need, and must have experienced a cumulative gap of five or more years between their first pursuit of an undergraduate degree and their current enrollment in the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies program. Raven Society In the fall and spring, B.I.S. submits a list of eligible students to the Raven Society. Membership in the Society is based on evidence of strong commitment to the University and academic excellence. Stephen T. Thornton Outstanding Capstone Project Award This award(s) is given at the diploma ceremony each year to a graduating student(s) who has produced the best capstone project in B.I.S., as elected by a committee of faculty members and/or SCPS administrators. UVA B.I.S. Dean’s Scholarship The UVA B.I.S. Dean’s Scholarship is a one-time scholarship for incoming students to the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) degree completion program. These scholarships help students pay for tuition, fees or other costs of attendance in their first semester of the B.I.S. program. The scholarship will award each recipient up to $2,500. Individuals who apply to the B.I.S. program and are accepted for admission will be considered. A separate scholarship application is not required. This is a merit-based scholarship, and recipients are selected based on their B.I.S. application essays and the overall strength of their application in demonstrating potential for success in the program. For more information, please contact scps-scholarships@virginia.edu B.I.S. Degree Requirements by Concentration The B.I.S. curriculum has five components: Liberal Studies Seminars; Conduct of Inquiry Courses; a concentration; degree elective courses; Capstone Project I and II.\\xa0 The number of degree elective courses required will vary depending upon the student’s concentration and the number of credits upon admission. A minimum of nine credits of degree electives at the University must be in upper-division humanities/social sciences (e.g., 3000/4000 level ISSS or ISHU courses or approved courses from the College of Arts & Sciences). A maximum of 45 business related credits can be applied toward the 120 credits for the B.I.S. degree. Those applying to the Business concentration can transfer a maximum of 15 business credits at admission. Students pursuing a concentration in Business, Cybersecurity Analysis, Early Childhood, Healthcare Management, or Information Technology are generally expected to complete their degree electives in liberal arts courses from various humanities and social sciences disciplines. However, in consultation with the faculty advisor, a student may select electives from the concentration categories listed above. Stackable Credits Students who have completed the SCPS Information Technology,\\xa0Cybersecurity Analysis, or Cloud Computing undergraduate certificate and are considering “stacking” the classes into the corresponding B.I.S. concentration (Individualized Concentration for Cloud Computing) should communicate that desire during the pre-admission advising process and in the application. Stackable courses from the certificate used to satisfy B.I.S. concentration requirements should be no more than seven years old when the B.I.S. degree is completed. A student may not simultaneously earn a B.I.S. degree and an SCPS Certificate. B.I.S. students who have recently completed the SCPS Information Technology, Cybersecurity Analysis, or Cloud Computing certificate, but are pursuing an alternative (non-stackable) B.I.S. concentration, may use some of those certificate credits as B.I.S. degree electives if they are no more than seven years old when the B.I.S. degree is completed. Students should consult with the B.I.S. Director upon admission to the program.\\xa0Students who have completed courses at the FBI National Academy or the National Criminal Justice Command College should consult with SCPS admissions staff to determine how those credits can be applicable to B.I.S. course requirements. Concentrations The B.I.S. program offers students\\xa0eleven concentration options. Courses that fulfill concentration requirements must be upper-division (3000-level or 4000-level).

Degree Requirements for Teacher Licensure Details about requirements for the degree and licensure can be found on the Teacher Education website . Requirements are subject to change as state regulations are revised. The Teacher Education office will communicate these changes to students. Eligibility for Licensure Students must complete all course, clinical, and licensure requirements to complete the Teacher Education program and to be eligible for licensure. A student may choose not to pursue licensure. Students may also be placed on the non-licensure track if their program performance precludes them from successfully completing the program’s clinical experience requirements. If the student is on the non-licensure track, the following policies will be in effect: Students must sign a form acknowledging that in not pursuing student teaching, they will not be eligible for licensure. Students will not be eligible to return to UVA to complete a standalone student teaching placement to finish the state-approved licensure program.\\xa0UVA students must be enrolled in a full-time degree program to complete student teaching and cannot return later to complete that requirement on its own. Students will graduate with a degree in Special Education. However, they will be given an “ineligible for licensure” designation in SIS. If students return to the university seeking a licensure verification form, the university will not be able to sign this form. Students will need to complete the 120 credits required for the degree. The 120 credits must include all major coursework and general studies requirements. The following requirements will be adjusted: Licensure requirements (exams and statutory requirements) will be waived. Internships (EDIS 4867 and EDIS 4887) will be waived. Students may not take the student teaching seminar (EDIS 4877) and will be required to choose a substitute course approved by the Director of Teacher Education. Public Professional Licensure Disclosure As a member of the State Authorizations Reciprocity Agreement, the University of Virginia (UVA) is authorized to provide curriculum in a distance learning environment to students located in all states in the United States except for California. (34 CFR 668.43(a)(6)& 34 CFR 668.72(n)). Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science in Special Education at the UVA School of Education and Human Development, graduates may be eligible for initial professional licensure in another U.S. state by applying to the licensing board or agency in that state. Please visit the University’s state authorization web pages to make an informed decision regarding which states’ educational requirements for initial licensure are met by this program. (668.43(a)(5) (v)(A) - (C)) Enrolled students who change their current (or mailing) address to a state other than Virginia should update this information immediately in the Student Information System as it may impact their ability to complete internship, practicum, or clinical hours, use Title IV funds, or meet licensure or certification requirements in the new state.

       "  'Text': 'Kinesiology (BSEd) Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Education and Human Development: Degree Programs Program Description Kinesiology refers to the study of movement and is a multifaceted field of study in which movement or physical activity is the intellectual focus. Physical activity includes exercising for improvement of health and fitness; learning movement skills; and engaging in activities of daily living, work, sport, dance, and play. It involves the general population as well as special groups such as children and older adults; people with disabilities, injuries, or disease; and athletes. Majoring in Kinesiology opens the door for a career in everything from fitness-related industries, to teaching, coaching, and health-related fields like medicine, public health, and physical or occupational therapy. The School of Education and Human Development is dedicated to providing hands-on experiences for students. That means students not only learn in the classroom, but on the field, in the lab, in the clinic, and with faculty. Faculty prepare students for what comes beyond college—graduate school, medical school or a career in a variety of areas. The blend of experiences students receive as a Kinesiology major, especially the field and clinical practice, prepare them in ways that other majors cannot. Kinesiology students work alongside some of the area’s finest in the wellness field. The Kinesiology major leads to a B.S.Ed. degree. Students take courses both in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the School of Education and Human Development. Students are expected to meet all general education requirements in their first two years, so they can concentrate on Kinesiology courses in years three and four. Students who enter with dual enrollment, AP and/or IB credits can opt to accelerate their studies, earning a B.S.Ed. and M.Ed in five years. Accelerated study is available in Exercise Physiology and Kinesiology for Individuals with Disabilities. Interested students need to apply to one of the M.Ed. programs by October 15 of the fourth year. GRE scores are due before the end of fall semester. An admission decision is made before the beginning of spring semester. Residence Requirement (60 credits) A recipient of a B.S.Ed. degree from the School of Education and Human Development must complete at least 60 of the 120 credits required for graduation\\xa0 at the University of Virginia. Exceptions for emergency situations may only be granted with the advisor’s and dean’s permission. In addition, all students must be full-time (12 credits minimum) during all semesters, except the final one. Though there are a number of required courses, students also have opportunities to shape coursework according to career goals, including adding a second major or a minor inside or outside of the School of Education and Human Development. A faculty member from kinesiology will serve as the academic advisor, assisting students with the selection of classes. The advisor will also help students consider optimal settings for gaining hands-on experiences in clinical, athletic, or school setting. Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement Students must earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 on all courses attempted at the University. B.S.Ed.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Aerospace engineering is concerned with the science and technology underlying the behavior and design of vehicles and systems that operate within the atmosphere and in space. It requires knowledge of a wide range of subject areas, including the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences as well as specialized studies in aerodynamics, propulsion systems, structures, materials, flight dynamics, astronautics, and computational methods. This broad background qualifies the graduating engineer not only to handle problems that are special to the aerospace field, but also to meet challenges of an interdisciplinary nature facing society, such as those involving the environment, transportation, and energy resources. The Aerospace Engineering curriculum provides a thorough background in fluid dynamics, structures, propulsion, controls, flight dynamics and design. The curriculum provides flexibility with regard to all areas of potential aerospace practice by emphasizing applied science, design, and technology while providing a firm foundation in mathematics and physics.\\xa0 Students will use symbolic and high-level mathematics tools, solid modeling and finite element analysis tools, as well as computational fluid dynamics and materials selection tools.\\xa0 They also have access to a state-of-the art rapid prototyping facility with numerous 3D course\\xa0printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, and the like.\\xa0 The rapid prototyping facility can be used both for course work, as well as individual entrepreneurial initiatives.\\xa0\\xa0With a strong science and mathematics based education, aerospace engineers have also found employment opportunities outside of the traditional aerospace industry. Many work in oceanography, biotechnology, weather prediction, energy conservation, and in the petrochemical, nuclear or automotive industries. In addition, the aerospace design provides an excellent background for business, law or medicine. Of course, people with the ambition to become pilots, either military or commercial, find the aerospace degree very attractive. Aerospace engineering principles are reinforced and integrated through design assignments and\\xa0 significant “hands-on” experience with the latest in test equipment and modern experimental methods. A three-semester lab sequence builds on a basic skills and science background to develop an appreciation for measurement techniques and apparatus as well as to demonstrate aerodynamic concepts.\\xa0 Students also develop communications skills and learn about the complex cultural, legal, ethical and economic factors which influence the engineering profession. Students who wish to may select courses that satisfy the requirements of a minor area of study (e.g., materials science, computer science, physics and engineering business, economics). Program Objectives Graduates of the Aerospace Engineering program at the University of Virginia have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that allow them to make tangible contributions, meet new technical challenges, contribute effectively as team members, and be innovators in the analysis and design of aerospace vehicle systems.\\xa0 They communicate effectively and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers and society.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Program Objective: Graduates draw upon their biomedical engineering foundations to perform experimental measurement, quantitative analysis, and engineering design. Graduates use tools and methods at the current state-of-the-art in biomedical engineering. Graduates apply problem solving abilities and multidisciplinary perspectives to understand and advance scientific discoveries and technological innovations. Graduates act to improve global and human health. Graduates exhibit intellectual curiosity, creativity, leadership and continuous personal growth. Program Description Biomedical engineering is built upon the premise that the tools and methods of engineering can be used to improve human health and enhance our understanding of the biological world. Biomedical engineering education integrates mathematics, science, engineering methodology, and engineering design to train individuals who are uniquely prepared for the collaborative challenges of this field. The end result of this type of training is knowledge, devices, materials, techniques and treatments to enhance human health. The foundation for these applications is the steady stream of discovery emerging from our nation’s academic and industrial research programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) has offered degrees at the master’s and doctoral level since 1967. BME introduced a bachelor’s of science degree in biomedical engineering in 2003. The major begins with an early, sound underpinning in the life sciences via two semesters of quantitative mammalian physiology and one semester of cell and molecular biology, alongside foundational knowlege in computational systems. Engineering fundamentals are taught in the context of biomedical engineering examples in systems analysis, biomechanics, and biotransport. In the 3rd year BME majors complete a two-semester IDEAS Lab, integrating concepts and skills from prior BME and other engineering course work. The BME major culminates in the 4th year with a capstone design project where students select, formulate, and solve a biomedically relevant design problem\\xa0whose deliverables include a device,\\xa0therapeutic, and/or\\xa0system. Throughout all four years, electives offer additional breadth and depth. The department encourages students to participate in research and inquiry-based learning above and beyond what is required by the curriculum. In the past students have pursued paid, volunteer, and “for-credit” positions in research labs, on design projects, and in industry or research internships. Research strengths in the department include systems biology and biomedical data science, tissue engnineering and biomaterials, biomedical imaging, gene and drug delivery, and biomechanics and mechanobiology. Interdepartmental research collaboration links the department with School of Engineering and Applied Science departments and clinical and basic science departments in the School of Medicine and the College of Arts and Sciences. Biomedical engineers contribute to society from positions in universities, hospitals, government, the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, and a broad range of research enterprises. As the discipline grows, BME graduates are finding that their broad education provides an excellent platform from which to launch rewarding careers; begin graduate studies; or pursue advanced degrees in medicine, law, and business.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Chemical engineering involves the application of mathematics, chemistry, physics and other sciences, such as biology and data science, to develop economic ways of using materials and energy for the benefit of humankind. Chemical engineers are involved in developing, processing, and marketing such varied products as fuels, pharmaceuticals, foods, plastics, metals, microelectronics, and basic/specialty chemicals. The Chemical Engineering program educational objective is as follows: Graduates of the Chemical Engineering program at the University of Virginia will utilize their technical competency\\xa0breadth of knowledge, communication and teamwork skills, and\\xa0adaptability to serve effectively and ethically in the chemical engineering profession; to become technical leaders in industry, government or academia; or to pursue advanced study in engineering and applied sciences and in professions such as law, business, and medicine. Our student outcomes are as follows. At graduation, ChE students are expected to have: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration for public health, safety, and welfare as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Many chemical engineers serve in the traditional chemical process industries of fuels, food and consumer products, chemicals, paper, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Some develop new products or processes through research, while others carry out the pilot studies and design work needed to bring innovations from the laboratory to manufacturing operations. Many are engaged in the operation and management of process plants including areas related to process safety risk management, and environmental health and safety. Others engage in marketing, and develop new applications for chemical products and serve as data analysts or as consultants in technical and financial sectors. Often a chemical engineer moves from one function to another throughout their career. Chemical engineers have long aided in energy and materials production from oil, gas, and coal. Today they are also heavily involved in research, development, and production of energy from alternative and sustainable renewable resources. Similarly, their chemical expertise and broad knowledge of processes are valuable in the identification and control of environmental problems, health care, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and in areas such as electronic materials production and nanotechnology. A chemical engineer’s career path is varied and rewarding and\\xa0allows\\xa0individual talents to grow and be fully utilized. In preparation for professional careers and graduate school, undergraduate studies for the B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering obtain\\xa0a strong foundation in both science and engineering. The curriculum progresses from mathematics and basic sciences\\xa0 (with an emphasis on chemistry), through engineering sciences, to applications in chemical process analysis, and culminates in a capstone design project. Computer methods, laboratory techniques, open-ended problem solving, team approaches, and effective written and oral communication are emphasized throughout the program.\\xa0Elective courses permit minors or concentrations in diverse technical and non-technical areas.\\xa0Recent students have completed minors in many other engineering and science\\xa0disciplines, in business, and in many different humanities and liberal arts programs. Students in the ChE program not only develop technical capability, but also learn to consider the safety, environmental, ethical, cultural, and economic dimensions of technological activities. Minimum Grade Requirements for ChE Prerequisite Courses A grade of C or CR\\xa0is the standard required in core CHE courses that are prerequisites for other CHE courses. Students cannot have more than one passing grade of less than C or CR\\xa0in core CHE prerequisite courses in order to enroll in any subsequent CHE courses. Students with more than one grade below C and/or CR\\xa0in more than one core CHE prerequisite course (CHE 2202, 2215, 2215, 3316, 3318, 3321, 3322, 3398, 4474 and 4475) will have to retake the prerequisite(s) and receive a grade of CR or C\\xa0or higher before taking any subsequent CHE courses. This policy applies to student pursuing the\\xa0B.S. degree or the\\xa0minor in chemical engineering. First-Year and Second-Year Program Chemical engineering students take two-semesters of general chemistry during the standard first-year engineering program. Because of varied individual long-term goals and the many options available in the chemical engineering program, consultation with a CHE advisor in the first semester of studies is strongly recommended. For example, the second semester chemistry course and laboratory are required for CHE majors and should be taken during the first year. Further, those planning on medical school should schedule a full year of biology, including laboratories.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Civil Engineering is the broadest of all engineering professions, and encompasses the application of science and technology to the planning, design, analysis, construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure and natural environment. The U.Va. Civil Engineering program, which was founded in 1836, is now designed to allow students to tailor their undergraduate degrees to their interests and goals, with curricular tracks in infrastructure systems, environmental and water resources, construction engineering and management, and structural engineering.\\xa0 All tracks lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering.\\xa0 The program also supports a minor in civil engineering, and graduate degrees at the Master of Engineering, Master of Science and Ph.D. levels. Civil engineers are the fabricators of modern society and the protectors of our environment. Our civil engineering program emphasizes the complex interrelationships between infrastructure, social systems, and the environment.\\xa0 We develop civil engineers who will seek to sustainably and equitably design, management and construct infrastructure systems, and who are prepared to innovate with new materials and create and use digital and virtual technologies.\\xa0 Civil infrastructure is diverse, including many subsystems such as stormwater and drinking water systems, waste management systems, neighborhoods, highways, railways, high-rise buildings and bridges.\\xa0 We develop the insight to anticipate how changes in one subsystem may affect the others and ultimately the environment, energy systems, communities, and the quality of life. Graduates with a BS degree in civil engineering may opt for employment with engineering and consulting ﬁrms; local, state, or federal governments; contractors or construction ﬁrms; public utilities; or industrial corporations. Many will attend graduate school to create more advanced employment opportunities in government, consulting, construction, or industry, and to introduce new choices, including research and teaching. Our students participate in research on a global scale through the engineering thesis and capstone experience, as well as a variety of exciting experiential programs, such as the minor in engineering business, the Science and Technology Policy Internship Program, study abroad programs, and interdisciplinary study within the School of Engineering and Applied Science and throughout the University. For more information about the civil engineering undergraduate program,\\xa0visit the department’s web site at https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/civil-and-environmental-engineering/academics/undergraduate . Program Objectives To provide graduates with the technical competencies and insight necessary to practice civil engineering and have an impact on the profession and pursue professional licensure. To provide a solid foundation for successful study at leading graduate and professional institutions. To promote a breadth of abilities and knowledge, including quantitative and analytical skills, communication skills and social insight, to allow graduates to pursue careers in a diversity of ﬁelds including engineering, business, and management. To prepare graduates for a lifetime of learning, for leadership, and for service to the profession and society. Civil Engineering Curriculum (128 Credits) Minimum required for graduation:\\xa0 128 credits Civil Engineering Civil engineering students share common degree requirements for the ﬁrst two years or four semesters before selecting one of four tracks: Infrastructure Systems (IS), Environmental & Water Resources (EWR), Construction Engineering and Management (CEM) or Structural Engineering (SE). Regardless of track, during the last two years, all CE students have 20 hours of the same required courses, plus 18 hours of electives in common. Thus, there is effectively a set of 25 remaining credit hours that may differ between these tracks. Footnotes follow the curriculum, which is listed by semester and explain which electives are credited as Science I, Humanities & Social Sciences (HSS), Technical I and II, Civil Engineering, Technical, Unrestricted, or track-specific electives. All four tracks are designed to provide students with a solid foundation for the practice of civil engineering and for subsequent graduate study. The Infrastructure Systems (IS) track provides a broad civil engineering education to prepare students to become practicing, licensed civil engineers, while still providing great career flexibility. This track includes training in structural design and materials, transportation, water resources, and geotechnical infrastructure design and planning. This track emphasizes hands-on laboratories and computer modeling and simulation workshops. The Environmental & Water Resources (EWR) track focuses on courses designed to provide a foundation for students interested in pursuing a career in environmental and water resources. The motivation for this track is the ever-increasing professional and societal emphasis on environmental quality and sustainability. The Construction Engineering and Management (CEM) track prepares students to transform engineering designs into infrastructure.\\xa0 The construction of civil engineering infrastructure typically requires the orchestration of a complex team of contractors, regulatory and safety constraints, and substantial investment.\\xa0 The CEM track combines civil engineering skills with the business and management skills required to create infrastructure. The Structural Engineering (SE) track allows students to focus on developing skills to design and construct large structures, such as bridges, stadiums, and high-rises.\\xa0 All students in this track learn the basics of CEM and complete additional courses emphasizes design using various building materials.\\xa0 Students in this track are well-prepared for practice or advanced studies in structural engineering.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Engineering Science (ES) is an interdisciplinary undergraduate engineering degree program. Students select an engineering science major in order to pursue interests in technical areas which lie at the interstices of traditional engineering disciplines or combine elements of engineering and science not currently possible through other degree programs. This degree program prepares students for careers in engineering or graduate study in fields for which there are no established undergraduate degree programs at the University of Virginia. The ES degree program recognizes that technology and society are evolving at such a rapid pace that a new discipline could emerge as an established career field before it is institutionalized as a degree offering. This program also affirms the unique role of the engineering scientist in the technology path from innovation to societal impact. Engineering Science students, in collaboration with their advisors, define a plan of study (POS).\\xa0 The POS identifies the curricular track, the primary technical minor, the secondary technical minor, and an area of concentration (AOC). The primary minor must satisfy the specific requirements of an approved technical minor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and must consist of at least six courses; the secondary minor must be selected from approved SEAS technical minors or from the natural science or mathematics minors within the College of Arts and Sciences. The courses required for specific minors are as listed by the relevant department in SEAS or CLAS. AOC courses are chosen to define clearly the major field of study or to add depth to the student’s plan. The advanced project courses, which may be used as a basis for the senior thesis, are designed to provide a research or engineering design experience, which unifies the three main components making up the plan of study.\\xa0 In all cases, both an advisor and the ES Program Director must approve the specific plan of study in order to guarantee that all degree requirements are being met. The flexibility offered by the Engineering Science degree program makes it an attractive degree for the following reasons: Engineering Science provides a rigorous technical curriculum, integrating engineering, natural science, and mathematics. It is especially suited for students interested in graduate study and/or basic research and development. In addition, it provides a path for preparation for professional training in law, business or medicine. As an interdisciplinary engineering program, Engineering Science prepares students for a career in an emerging field of engineering, in a field at the interstices of two existing engineering disciplines, or in a discipline for which there is presently no undergraduate degree offering at the University of Virginia.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is a field that couples basic and applied studies in physics, chemistry and mechanics on the atomistic and nanometer scales with macroscopic materials’ properties. Materials science is frequently an important enabler for many other scientific and engineering disciplines. For instance, advances in performance for future subsonic and hypersonic aircraft require new materials with greater durability at high temperatures and high strength-to-weight ratios. Advances in communication equipment with the introduction of fiber optic cables are brought about through the utilization of ceramic fibers which minimize attenuation of light signals and transmit much more information than is possible with electrically conducting wires. Advances in materials science and engineering enable the development of new technologies across most engineering disciplines. MSE offers a selection of undergraduate courses with the objective of providing students with a fundamental background in the structure, properties, processing, and performance of materials. This background is essential to engineers or scientists in understanding the selection of materials for various applications. A minor in Material Science and Engineering is available to all undergraduate students.

Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Return to: School of Engineering and Applied Science: Degree Programs Mechanical engineering is the broadest of the engineering disciplines, providing opportunities for employment in industry, business, government, research, and education. The mechanical engineer is concerned with the development of machines and systems for diverse applications in our modern technological society. Talents and interests of a graduate M.E. include those required to plan, analyze, design, and improve components and systems. The practice of mechanical engineering is applied to manufacturing, energy conversion, transportation, construction, and environmental control. In the future, mechanical engineers must provide leadership in developing new sources of power and new systems to accommodate societal demands. Students take a sequence of basic and engineering science courses. They develop engineering problem solving skills in the areas of mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, materials and automatic controls. Students learn to use higher mathematics, statistics and modern computer techniques and productivity tools. Students will use symbolic and high-level mathematics tools, solid modeling and finite element analysis tools, as well as computational fluids dynamics and materials selection tools. They also have access to a state-of the art rapid prototyping facility with numerous 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, and the like. The rapid prototyping facility can be used both for course work, as well as individual entrepreneurial initiatives. Mechanical engineering principles are reinforced and integrated through design assignments and “hands-on” laboratory courses in experimental methods, digital electronics, and electro-mechanical systems. Students conduct experiments in labs where they use digital data acquisition systems to evaluate the performance of instruments, motors, engines, electrical circuits, signal processing equipment and solid state control devices. For each lab module, students develop a hypothesis, design the experiment, carry out the test, and perform the data analysis. The three-semester lab sequence familiarizes students with the state-of-the-art equipment used in modern industry. Working both individually and in teams, students also develop communications skills and learn about the complex cultural, legal, ethical and economic factors which influence the engineering profession. Those who wish to may select courses that satisfy the requirements of a minor area of study (e.g., computer science, materials science, physics and engineering business). Young engineers need relevant experiences to be competitive in the global economy. As indicated by discussions with recruiters and industry leaders, graduating students are now expected to have some practical and/or unique experience that they will be able to apply in an industry in the near term.

Students receive exposure to a wide range of topics, including the economic, political, managerial, environmental, and technical aspects of large-scale systems design and implementation. Students are provided with diverse opportunities for hands-on experience with real-world situations and problems. The primary objectives of the Systems Engineering program are to graduate students who will: Engage in development, implementation, and optimization of systems that include humans, data and information, hardware, software, and natural and technology resources. Embark on sustainable, productive careers in systems engineering, applied science, and technology management. Excel in the practices of analytical modeling and integrative systems engineering. Seek and succeed in lifelong professional education that includes advanced schooling and mentoring. Contribute to the profession of systems engineering and to human welfare through professional societies, public service, and civic activities. The Systems Engineering curriculum is more flexible than many traditional engineering programs. In addition to the courses specifically required in the curriculum, students are able to take nine credits of unrestricted electives, nine credits of electives tailored to an application area, and six credits of technical electives. The curriculum allows students to pursue a specific area of interest within the broad framework of systems engineering. The following areas are available as application sequences: chemical and biomedical systems; electrical and computer engineering systems; software and information systems; data analytics; design integration; control and mechanical systems; economic systems; civil, environmental, and infrastructure systems; human factors; and mathematical systems. Appropriate ROTC courses may be counted as an application sequence in military systems. Student-Designed Application Sequence: Students wishing to design their own application sequence must submit their proposal to the Systems Undergraduate Studies Committee (UGSC) by December 15th of their third year. Students are highly encouraged to consult with their faculty advisors prior to submitting their application to the UGSC. The program culminates in a capstone design project, spanning both the fall and spring semesters of the fourth year. Students working in small teams under the direction of a faculty mentor are matched with a client from the public or private sector. Each team is assigned an open-ended design problem, and they apply the perspectives, methods, and tools of systems engineering that they learn in the classroom to the resolution of a problem for a client. A degree in Systems Engineering from UVA confers employability in a wide range of industries, governmental agencies, and non-profits. It offers students a variety of career choices in engineering and management, and also provides excellent pre-med, pre-business, and pre-law preparation. The award-winning program is one of the largest systems engineering programs in the United States, and the graduates of the program consistently receive higher salary offers than the national average for other systems programs and other engineering disciplines. The program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and received the first award of the Board for Curricular Innovation. The program also received the Outstanding Educator Award from the Boeing Company, which recognized UVA’s\\xa0Systems Engineering Program for its potential to “develop leaders prepared to shape the future.” Application forms and further information are available on the Systems & Information Engineering Department website . “D” Policy: Students minoring and majoring in Systems Engineering must receive a grade of “C-” or better in all required SYS courses, all required 3000 or higher level APMA courses, and CS 2100 in order to earn the major/minor in Systems Engineering.

This program is a\\u202ftwo-year\\xa0part-time hybrid program. Students enroll in 30 credits at the University of Virginia. Classes are offered in a part-time format to allow students to maintain employment while completing their BSN. \\u202fIn the hybrid format, students attend classes in person approximately once a month. Students are admitted\\xa0to\\xa0one of three locations: Charlottesville, Richmond or Northern Virginia. The program provides a foundation for professional practice and embraces the philosophy of life-long learning, encouraging further education such as graduate study for advanced practice or preparation as a clinical leader or teacher. The 120 hours of credit are earned as 48 general education requirements, 42 credit hours for select core nursing course in their prelicensure program, and the 30 credit hours of residency. The 42 credit hours are awarded for core academic nursing courses, taken in the student’s basic nursing program, that are comparable to core courses in UVA’s traditional BSN program.

Admission Requirements Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence Curricular Requirements Course Rules Degree Information Direct Admissions Policy Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Public Professional Licensure Disclosure Student Intellectual Property Transfer Credit Admission Requirements All prospective undergraduate students apply through the University Office of Undergraduate Admissions; http://www.admission.virginia.edu/ For general information about the School of Architecture and undergraduate admissions: https://www.arch.virginia.edu/apply/undergraduate-admissions Academic Standing Academic Good Standing Students, in the School of Architecture, are considered to be in academic good standing at the end of a semester if, in that semester, they meet the following criteria: • Complete at least 12 credits of coursework. • Maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA. • Have no more than one grade below C- (or NC for CR/NC). Academic Warning A student will be placed on academic warning\\xa0if they fail to maintain academic good standing in any semester (see the “Academic Good Standing” section of the Record). Part-time students incur academic probation if they do not maintain a cumulative 2.000-grade\\xa0point average. Academic Suspension Suspension is enforced withdrawal from the University. Any student who has previously been placed on academic probation will be suspended if placed on probation again. The term of the first suspension is through at least one full fall or one full spring semester. The term of a suspension may be longer, if the Dean’s Office decides it is appropriate for the circumstances. A second suspension is final and the student is not allowed to return to the University. Procedures for Returning to the University from suspension are described below under Returning to the University. Academic credits taken elsewhere while on academic suspension are not accepted for transfer towards a UVa degree. Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions in person, including lectures and other prescribed activities of the courses for which they are registered. Although the course instructor sets course attendance requirements, any student who is absent from more than 50 percent of the class sessions may automatically receive a grade of F in that course. Consistent with the UVA Undergraduate Record, unless otherwise notified by the instructor, students enrolled in all School of Architecture undergraduate courses are required to attend every scheduled class session in person and to arrive on time prepared for the class. If you are unable to attend a class session for any reason, you must notify your instructor in advance of the class. In courses where class participation represents a portion of the course grade, the instructor has complete discretion to assign the class participation grade that s/he decides is appropriate. Faculty may drop students from their course with notification who are not in attendance on the first day of the semester. Class Standing Students are categorized by class according to the number of credits they have earned as follows: first year: 0-29 credits; second year: 30-59 credits; third year: 60-89 credits; fourth year: 90 or more credits. AP and transfer credits are included in the computation of class standing; credits not completed or completed unsuccessfully are not included. Students in the Department of Architecture are classified according to their studio level. Satisfactory Progress Toward a Degree In order to enroll for a fifth semester , students must have earned at least 54 semester hours (includes approved summer, transfer, AP, IB and dual enrollment credits). To enroll for a seventh semester , students must have earned at least 84 semester hours\\xa0(includes approved summer, transfer, AP, IB and dual enrollment credits). Students may not enroll in a ninth semester except under very special circumstances. Barring unusual circumstances, and with the written approval of the Dean’s office, students who have completed eight semesters must complete any remaining degree requirements as a part-time student. Students are permitted to take a total of 16 credits on a part-time basis toward the degree. No more than\\xa06 credits/two courses may be taken in a given semester. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. If there is not a satisfactory outcome, the student must consult with the Director of Advising in conjunction with the undergraduate program director of the department. If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to the Associate Dean of Academics. Appeals must be made within 7 days after the end of that semester’s examination period. Grievances Procedures Due process is guaranteed to all students. See “Grievance Procedures” in the University Regulations section or consult the Associate Dean of Academics. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List To be eligible for the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students at the end of each semester, students must earn at least 15 credits of graded work, with a GPA of 3.7 or above for that semester.\\xa0 Courses taken on a CR/NC basis may not be counted toward the 15-credit minimum. Commencement Honors Students who have demonstrated high academic achievement in pursuit of the bachelor’s degree are eligible for commencement honors. Diplomas inscribed “with honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.600. Diplomas inscribed “with high honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.750. Diplomas inscribed “with highest honors” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.900. Curricular Requirements General Education Requirements in the School of Architecture Undergraduate Curriculum The undergraduate curriculum of the School of Architecture reflects our mission: to teach students how to study buildings, landscapes, and cities as forms and systems, and to imagine the design of more sustainable, functional, and socially equitable places. Students pursue this mission through three different majors: architectural history, architecture, and urban and environmental planning. The School’s general education requirements establish a strong foundation in the traditional liberal arts categories of humanities/fine arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural sciences/mathematics. The general education curriculum is intended to equip students with the necessary tools of analytical, synthetic, and critical thinking, while also highlighting the role of the built environment in the complex conditions that profoundly shape the present and the future. The School of Architecture requires that each undergraduate complete 30 credits in General Education, 18 of which are to be taken in these categories: Humanities/Fine Arts: 6 credits Math/Natural Sciences: 6 credits Social/Behavioral Sciences: 6 credits The remaining 12 credits may be fulfilled with classes from within any of these three above-listed categories unless proscribed more specifically by the student’s major curriculum. General Education Course Curriculum in the Common First Year Humanities Elective: 3 credits Math/Nat Science Elective: 3 credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective: 3 credits General Education Elective: 3 credits For a detailed distribution of the General Education requirements in the first-year curriculum, refer to Common First Year General Education Course Curriculum in the Department of Architectural History (years 2-4) Environmental Science Elective: 3 credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective: 3 credits (Non-Western) Humanities Elective: 3 credits. General Education Electives: 9 credits For a detailed distribution of the General Education requirements in the curriculum for the Architectural History major, years 2-4, refer to Architectural History . General Education Course Curriculum in the Department of Architecture (years 2-4) Physics Elective: 3 credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective: 3 credits Humanities Elective: 3 credits General Education Electives: 9 credits For a detailed distribution of the General Education requirements in the curriculum for the architecture major, years 2-4, refer to Architecture General Education Course Curriculum in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning (years 2-4) Econ 2010 & 2020:\\xa06 credits Humanities Elective: 3 credits Math/Natural Science Elective: 3 Credits Politics Elective: 6 Credits Social/Behavioral Science Elective:\\xa012 credits For a detailed distribution of the General Education requirements in the curriculum for the\\xa0Urban and Environmental Planning major,\\xa0years 2-4, refer to Urban and Environmental Planning Course Rules Course Load Registering for fewer than 12 credits or more than 18 credits in a semester requires special permission. Students who have declared their major must obtain written permission from the Director of their undergraduate program; students who are undeclared must obtain written permission from the Director of Advising+Academic Support.\\xa0Students who are on warning or in the semester immediately following suspension must obtain additional permission from the Associate Dean of Academics. Electives For students in the School of Architecture the following limits apply to elective courses: •\\xa0Kinesiology (KINE, KLPA)\\xa0courses cannot be used for degree credit. • A maximum of 12-degree credits will be granted for (ROTC) courses. • A maximum of 8-degree credits will be granted for Ensemble Music or Dance. • CR/NC grading option - no more than 1 course per semester, must be counted as an open elective. Part-Time Enrollment Students are ordinarily expected to be enrolled as full-time students.\\xa0 However, students may choose to enroll for a semester or two on a part-time basis.\\xa0 Part-time students are limited to two courses per semester or a maximum of\\xa0six credits.\\xa0 Students may not count more\\xa0than 16 credits taken on a part-time basis toward the degree. Temporary part-time status requires the Associate Dean of Academics and the Director of Advising + Academic Support approval.\\xa0Students registered full-time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their registration to part-time status. Repeated Courses In accordance with the University policy , when a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and opts to take it the second time, both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the highest of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. If a student earns C- or higher and chooses to retake the course a second time for credit, both grades will be included in the computation of the grade point average and appear on the student’s transcript. A student may repeat a course only once. Student Owned Computers Undergraduate students are\\xa0required to own a personal computer equipped with specified software when they enter the program. A list of specifications is at http://www.arch.virginia.edu/IT_Resources/Computer_Requirements . Degree Information ^TOP The School of Architecture offers three undergraduate programs of instruction under Architectural History, Architecture, and Urban and Environmental Planning. Supporting course work is offered through the cooperation of departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. First-year students take a common core curriculum and declare their major near the end of the second semester. Evaluations of courses and curricula modification are continuing processes in the school. Therefore, the specific degree requirements are subject to change. In each of the degree programs, students should expect that courses may require the purchase of textbooks, software, materials, or equipment. Students may incur costs for field trips. Accreditation The Undergraduate Program in Urban and Environmental Planning is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board, sponsored jointly by the American Institute of Certified Planners and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning. Bachelor of Architectural History This four-year program is one of the few of its kind in the country. Students are offered a liberal arts education with an emphasis on the study of architectural history. This degree program provides an opportunity to study historic preservation, while offering ample opportunity for interaction with the other disciplines in the school Bachelor of Science\\xa0(Architecture) The undergraduate degree in architecture offers two tracks: the pre-professional track, and the design-thinking track. The pre-professional track is useful for those seeking a foundation in the field of architecture either for continued education in a professional degree program or for employment in design-related fields. The design-thinking track is aimed at students seeking to apply the creative approach of architectural design to broader areas of application. Concerning the pre-professional track, most states consider an accredited degree a requirement to obtaining an architecture license. There are two types of degrees that are accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB): the Bachelor of Architecture, which requires a minimum of five years of study; and the Master of Architecture. The four-year pre-professional degree is not accredited by NAAB. Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning The Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning is a professional degree recognized by the Planning Accreditation Board. During the final two years of study, the student has a wide range of professional seminars and application courses to choose from in the areas of environmental planning, land use planning, and growth management, and urban development and housing policy. This course of study is designed to develop an integrative knowledge of environmental and community processes, professional skills, and leadership. Grades Audit (AU) Grade Option You may audit courses with the permission of the instructor. Courses successfully taken on an audit basis have the symbol AU (audit) recorded in the grade column of the academic record. As\\xa0no credits or grade points are earned in audited courses, these courses are\\xa0not applicable toward a degree. Instructors have the option of deciding whether students may or may not take their courses on an audit basis. A grade of W is recorded for any student who discontinues the audit after the drop deadline or who fails to meet the instructor’s standards. Credit/No Credit (Grades) Students have the option of receiving a CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of regular letter grades for a given course. This option is selected when students register for courses no later than the add deadline. Instructors have the right to deny students permission to take courses on a CR/NC basis. The CR/NC option may be used only for open electives. Grade Changes After a grade has been submitted to UREG (Office of the University Registrar), it cannot be changed without the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics. The Associate Dean of Academics is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to UREG (Office of the University Registrar) except when an instructor certifies that, due to errors in omission, calculation, or transcription, an incorrect grade was submitted. Under no circumstances can a grade be improved by completing extra work that is in addition to what was communicated in the course syllabus and/or assignments throughout the regular sequence of the semester. The time period allowed for a grade change ends on the first day of class of the subsequent fall or spring semester when the grade was given.\\xa0 If evidence is discovered that a student has violated the integrity of the course, a grade can be changed at the time of the conclusion of this assessment. Requirements Students in the School of Architecture must achieve a minimum grade of C- in required courses. or else be required to repeat the course. Incomplete Grade (IN) A grade of “Incomplete” (IN) is to be given only in cases due to medical emergencies and extenuating family circumstances that necessitate additional time to complete course work.\\xa0 A request for an ‘IN’ is to be submitted to the School of Architecture Registrar prior to the last day of exams\\xa0using the “Incomplete Grade” form approved by the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 An ‘IN’ is not considered an acceptable default final grade and will convert to a grade of ‘F’ five days after the end of the examination period unless an “Incomplete Grade” form is submitted by the course professor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 Documentation supporting the medical excuse is to be provided by a doctor or healthcare provider with the “Incomplete Grade” form. Additionally, a work plan outlining the scope and extended deadline for completion of coursework is due to the Associate Dean of Academics at the time of the form submittal.\\xa0 An approved grade of ‘IN’ will convert automatically to a grade of ‘F’ four weeks after the end of the examination period unless the professor submits a final grade based on the work completed during the additional time or a work plan identifying a specific date for completion of course work.\\xa0 Instructors are not authorized to extend the time for completion of course work without the approval of the Associate Dean of Academics Withdrawals Grading System If a student decides to discontinue a course after the drop deadline, they must withdraw from the class (see note below). Students have eight weeks from the start of the semester to leave a class using this option. This will result in a ‘W’ on the student’s transcript. If, after the withdrawal deadline has passed, a student is enrolled in a class, but has never attended , the student will need to contact the Director of Advising+Academic Support. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade. If a student is failing a course after the withdrawal date and at the end of the semester due to lack of attendance and/or due to not meeting the academic standards of performance set by the professor/SIA of the course, the student will receive an ‘F’ as their final grade. A student is allowed to withdraw from classes in SIS until 11:59 PM on the day of the class withdrawal deadline date, see https://www2.virginia.edu/registrar/calendar.html . To get started, go to the drop tab in the SIS Student Center. Use the DROP transaction for the desired class. When the message is received about withdrawing, click on the “Request Class Withdrawal” link and follow the directions. Intra-University Transfer School of Architecture students wishing to transfer to another School within the University must consult visit the specific school to review deadlines and admission requirements. Students wishing to transfer into the School of Architecture from another School within the University must first meet with the School of Architecture’s Director of Advising and Academic Support to discuss transfer options and course selection. Leaving and Returning to the University Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Students who are forced to withdraw during a given term will have the notation “Withdrawal Date: MM/DD/YYYY ” entered on their permanent academic records following the semester in which the action occurred. A grade of W (withdrawal)\\xa0will be entered for each course in which the student was registered. Students who have been forced to withdraw must apply for readmission with their dean’s office in the same manner as suspended students. A grade of W cannot be changed. Leave of Absence Students who wish to take a leave of absence for either a semester or a year must apply for such leave by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center and communicating with the Associate Dean of Academics. A student who wishes to suspend their full-time status for a temporary period of time must request approval from the director of undergraduate studies and the Associate Dean of Academics.\\xa0 As a result, this leave of absence will postpone their expected date of graduation.\\xa0 The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of Academics as part of the approval process. A student who wishes to take a leave of absence must apply by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center, no later than one week prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to be on leave.\\xa0 Leave of Absences are approved for a full semester or one academic year. How to Apply for Leave of Absence Email the Associate Dean of Academics,Director of Advising + Academic Support, and the Director of the Program in which you are enrolled, about your intentions on taking a Leave of Absence. If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services ( sfs@virginia.edu ) prior to that semester. Contact the International Studies Office (if applicable) at issp@virginia.edu . Fill out the “Leaving the University” e-form in your SIS student center. It is located on the bottom left side of the home page. This process will need to be no later than one week prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to be on leave. Once the e-form has been approved, you will receive an email from the University Registrar’s Office (UREG) that the process has been completed. Students must complete the “Returning to the University” form in their SIS Student Center by March 1st\\xa0for fall + summer semesters, and October 1st\\xa0for the Spring semester,\\xa0(Please see “Returning to the University” section). Students who wish to leave all of their classes during a fall or spring semester at any time after the first day of classes and through the last day of exams must request permission to withdraw from the University by completing the “Leaving the University” form in their SIS Student Center, communicating with their school dean’s office, If the student’s academic dean or designee approves the student’s request to withdraw, ODOS will discuss the proposed withdrawal with the student and, if appropriate, grant final approval. UREG will notify the student once the withdrawal becomes official. Students requesting to withdraw from the University must be aware of the following rules: Students under the age of 18 must give notice to their parents or legal guardians of their intention to withdraw. Evidence of this notice must be provided before a withdrawal request will be approved. Applications for withdrawal must be approved by the student’s academic dean or designee. Undergraduate students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period. Students may specify on the “Leaving the University” form whether their request to withdraw is for medical reasons. Students approved for withdrawal for medical reasons will need a medical review from the Department of Student Health before they will be approved for readmission to the University; this medical review may take up to three weeks in addition to any deadline set by their school, so students should apply as early as possible when they wish to return to the University. Students who voluntarily withdraw from the University will have the notation “Withdrew: DATE” recorded on their permanent academic record and their official transcript. Undergraduate students will receive a grade of W in all classes. A grade of W cannot be changed. Students wishing to withdraw from classes during Summer Session or J-Term should contact the Office of Summer & Special Academic Programs, 434-924-3371; summer@virginia.edu or januaryterm@virginia.edu . In extreme medical circumstances, documented by a medical professional, a School of Architecture student has one semester in which to petition to the Dean’s Office for a retroactive medical withdrawal. If approved, all grades convert to W’s. Returning to the University Students who wish to return to the University after an absence must be formally readmitted to their last school of enrollment. Readmission requires review and approval by the Associate Dean of Academics, the Department of Student Health (if applicable), the International Studies Office (if applicable), the Office of Student Financial Services (if applicable). Students who withdrew for medical reasons will need a medical review from the Department of Student Health before they will be approved for readmission to the University; this medical review may take up to three weeks in addition to any deadline set by their school, so students should apply as early as possible when they wish to return to the University. Students must complete the “Returning to the University” form in their SIS Student Center by March 1st for the fall + summer semesters,\\xa0and October\\xa01st for the spring semester.\\xa0If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services prior to that semester. Students completing the application must include a statement that (1) addresses the student’s readiness to return to the University in light of any serious difficulties, academic suspension, or extenuating circumstances related to his/her absence (e.g. financial, medical, or personal hardship), and (2) outlines the student’s academic plan for his/her remaining semesters. How to Apply for Readmission Email the Associate Dean of Academics and the Director of the Program in which you are enrolled, about your intentions on coming back to the A-School. Email the Director of Advising + Academic Support about your curriculum. Contact the International Studies Office (if applicable) at issp@virginia.edu . If students want to ensure their eligibility for financial aid, they should contact Student Financial Services ( sfs@virginia.edu ) prior to that semester Fill out the “returning to the university” e-form in your SIS student center. It is located on the bottom left side of the home page. This process can be started by March 1st for the fall + summer semesters,\\xa0and October\\xa01st for the spring semester. Once the e-form has been approved, you will receive an email from the University Registrar’s Office (UREG) that the process has been completed. Returning to the University\\xa0is not guaranteed. Majors and Minors Declaring the Major The first year of study in the School of Architecture includes courses in all three undergraduate programs, as well as breadth requirements. During the second semester of the first year, students declare a major in one of the three programs. In the event a particular major or concentration is oversubscribed, admission may be limited. Admission to such programs is based on space availability, academic performance, and additional materials as specified by particular departments. Double Majors According to University policy, students may receive a degree from only one undergraduate school. Undergraduate students who complete the requirements for more than one undergraduate degree program will be awarded a double major. This notation is placed on the transcript but not on the diploma. Students enrolled in the School of Architecture and pursuing a double major must comply with the requirements and policies for both majors. Students not enrolled in the School of Architecture may pursue a second major in the School, provided such a second major is consistent with the policies of their school of enrollment, and the student fulfills all the academic requirements of the major in the School of Architecture. Minors Students enrolled in the School of Architecture and pursuing a minor must comply with the requirements and policies of the school. Students not enrolled in the School of Architecture may pursue a minor in the School of Architecture, provided such a minor is consistent with the policies of their school of enrollment, and the student fulfills all the academic requirements of the minor in the School of Architecture. Public Professional Licensure Disclosure As a member of the State Authorizations Reciprocity Agreement, the University of Virginia (UVA) is authorized to provide curriculum in a distance learning environment to students located in all states in the United States except for California. (34 CFR 668.43(a)(6)& 34 CFR 668.72(n)). Upon completion graduates may be eligible for initial professional licensure in another U.S. state by applying to the licensing board or agency in that state. Please visit the University’s state authorization web pages to make an informed decision regarding which states’ educational requirements for initial licensure are met by this program. (668.43(a)(5) (v)(A) - (C)) Enrolled students who change their current (or mailing) address to a state other than Virginia should update this information immediately in the Student Information System as it may impact their ability to complete internship, practicum, or clinical hours, use Title IV funds, or meet licensure or certification requirements in the new state. (34 CFR 668.402). Student Intellectual Property Ownership of Student Work The School of Architecture follows University Regulations concerning Student Intellectual Property. As a condition of enrollment in the School of Architecture, each Architecture student is deemed to have granted the University a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, or publicly display the student’s coursework, with appropriate credit and attribution, for educational or research purposes only. Any use beyond this limited license requires express written consent of the student. Transfer Credit Residence Requirements and Transfer Credits All three programs normally require four years for completion and a minimum of two years as a full-time student in the School of Architecture. In some cases, summer session study at the University is required of transfer undergraduate applicants accepted by the School of Architecture. Summer Session; ARCH 1031 is a prerequisite for undergraduate transfer students accepted in the department of Architecture entering their second year.\\xa0 ARCH 2011 and ARCH 2021 are prerequisites for undergraduate transfer students accepted by the department of Architecture entering their third year. The School of Architecture grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended major and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. The Dean’s Office of the School of Architecture governs the awarding of transfer credit. Students must submit a request for transfer of credit form prior to enrolling in courses for transfer. Transfer credit is allowed only for those courses in which a grade of C or better has been earned. Grades do not transfer and do not affect the student’s cumulative grade point average at the University of Virginia. In no case are transfer credits in excess of 60 granted toward an undergraduate degree in the School of Architecture. The school does not accept pass/fail or credit/no credit courses for transfer credit. In exceptional circumstances, the School of Architecture Dean may waive an admission or performance requirement when, in the dean’s judgment, such action best serves the intent of the program.

Academic Advising Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence College Curriculum Course Rules Degree Information Final Examinations Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Study Abroad Transfer Credit Academic Advising Academic advising for College undergraduates is the responsibility of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, the assistant deans in the College (known as Association Deans), and the faculty of the departments within the College.\\xa0 Detailed information about the academic policies and programs of the College, along with links to Departmental homepages is available at http://college.as.virginia.edu . In order to provide every entering student with individual academic advising, the College uses the association system.\\xa0 The student body of the College is partitioned into numerous associations representing either first-year residence halls, Echols Scholars, student-athletes, veterans, or transfer students.\\xa0 Each association has an Association Dean who serves as the academic advising dean throughout a student’s time in the College.\\xa0 The Association Deans are experts regarding the academic policies and rules of the College, as well as the whole range of academic and non-academic resources available to undergraduates in the College.\\xa0 The Association Deans are at the nexus of College advising and thus serve as the principal links between academic advising and the more general concerns of residential life in the College. In addition to Association Deans, upon matriculation every student is assigned a faculty member who serves as the student’s faculty advisor for the first two years.\\xa0 Third-year and fourth-year students are assigned a major department advisor by their major department.\\xa0 Each department and interdepartmental program has a faculty member designated as the Director of the Undergraduate Program who is charged with organizing undergraduate advising in its major.\\xa0 These persons are thoroughly informed about every course offered for undergraduates in their respective fields. A list of the Directors appears online at the College’s website: http://college.as.virginia.edu/ugrad-directors .\\xa0 Midway through each semester, the departments and interdepartmental programs in the College issue a complete description of courses to be offered in the following semester through SIS. Pre-Health Advising While there is no pre-medical minor or concentration at the University, a student planning to apply to medical, dental, or veterinary school should bear the following in mind when planning his/her undergraduate curriculum: Virtually all medical schools require one-year courses with laboratory in chemistry, biology, organic chemistry, and physics. Some schools also list requirements in English, mathematics, and the social sciences. Prospective students in health education should major in the subject that interests them most, as professional schools in the health sciences do not require specific undergraduate majors for admission.\\xa0 However, non-science majors should elect the requisite science courses as they pursue their major, and science majors should elect advanced courses in the humanities and social sciences while they pursue their major.\\xa0 Demonstrating a broad education in the liberal arts to admissions committees is most important.\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean regarding Pre-Health advising.\\xa0 Additional advising is available through the University Career Center. Pre-Law Advising There is no pre-law program in the College, as law schools typically look for high achieving students regardless of their College major.\\xa0 Students interested in law school should take a broad liberal education that develops their writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills.\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean regarding Pre-Law advising.\\xa0 Additional advising is available through the University Career Center. Student Disability Accommodations The University provides a Student Disabilities Access Center for students with diagnosed disabilities.\\xa0 Upon the recommendation of this Center, students with diagnosed disabilities receive appropriate learning accommodations in their courses.\\xa0 More information can be found at https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/ .\\xa0 Students diagnosed with a specific language learning disability are referred to the policy outlined below in the Course Rules section. Study Abroad Advising Both world languages and international studies are strong academic programs in the College.\\xa0 Many opportunities exist, some of them unique to this University, for studying abroad.\\xa0 Many students graduating from the College offer some credit from study abroad toward their degrees.\\xa0 Plans for study abroad should be made well in advance of the intended semester of study.\\xa0 Students contemplating study abroad should consult an advisor in the International Studies Office in Minor Hall.\\xa0 A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.500, after the student’s most recent enrollment in Charlottesville, is required to receive credits from studying abroad.\\xa0 Students considering study abroad should bear in mind that no more than 60 credits transferred from other universities, foreign study, advanced placement, and dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 Students participating in the University’s direct study programs, however, count these credits as having been completed in Charlottesville, i.e. they do not count as transfer credits subject to the 60 credit maximum. Writing Center The Writing Center offers free individual tutoring sessions to students who wish to improve their academic prose.\\xa0 Tutors can help students focus a thesis, organize an argument, fashion a style appropriate to an assignment, and use correct punctuation and grammar.\\xa0 For more information, visit the Writing Center website at http://professionalwriting.as.virginia.edu/welcome-writing-center. Academic Standing After every semester, the Office of the Dean of the College reviews each student’s academic standing and progress toward the degree.\\xa0 If a problem arises, a student’s Association Dean notifies the student by e-mail of important information to be accessed at a secure website.\\xa0 Students are responsible for regularly checking their University email account to obtain\\xa0this information and are subject to the imposition of academic sanctions even if they do not check their email. Academic\\xa0Warning Students who do not meet standards for Good Standing in a fall or spring term incur academic warning.\\xa0 The notation “Academic Warning” is placed on the advising transcript for the semester in which the warning was incurred.\\xa0 A student on\\xa0academic warning is expected to meet with his or her Association Dean no later than the add period of the ensuing semester.\\xa0 Students on academic warning are strongly urged to devote more time to their academic work and are referred to academic support services. Part-time students incur academic warning if they do not attain a 1.800 semester grade point average. Students on academic warning who withdraw or take a leave of absence are eligible to apply for readmission.\\xa0 When readmitted, they are on academic warning\\xa0and must attain Good Standing or face Academic Suspension by virtue of two consecutive semesters of incurring Academic Warning. Good Standing Students are considered to be in good standing at the end of a semester if, in that semester, they have completed at least 12 credits of course work with at least a 1.800 semester grade point average and have no more than one grade below C-.\\xa0 In order to enroll in a fifth semester, students are expected\\xa0to have passed at least 54 credits; to enroll in a seventh semester students are expected to have\\xa0passed at least 84 credits.\\xa0 Students who do not accumulate this number of credits are required to develop and have approved by their Association Dean an academic plan for degree completion, which can include Summer Session courses, additional credits in the following semester, credits at another accredited institution, or taking more than eight full-time semesters to complete their degree.\\xa0 Upon approval of such a plan, students will be permitted to continue to enroll full-time.\\xa0 To remain in good standing by the end of the fourth semester, students must either be in a major or have received permission from the dean’s office to defer the declaration of a major for one semester.\\xa0 Part-time students are considered to be in good standing if they achieve at least a 1.800 grade point average for the semester. Suspension Students are subject to suspension after incurring academic warning in two consecutive semesters or after only one semester if they fail to earn at least nine grade points in that semester.\\xa0 One full fall term and one full spring term must elapse before they are eligible to apply to\\xa0return to the College.\\xa0 After a first suspension, the College considers application for readmission upon presentation of evidence that the difficulties that led to the academic suspension have been overcome (see below).\\xa0 Students under suspension forfeit commitments of financial aid.\\xa0 Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree from the College.\\xa0 Two semesters must pass before a suspended student may enroll in the University’s Summer Session.\\xa0 A student who receives a second academic suspension may not return to the University. Students to whom notice of suspension has been sent have five business days in which to notify their Association Dean of an intention to appeal.\\xa0 Academic suspension becomes effective upon the Dean’s notification to UREG (University Registrar). That date is determined according to the schedule below or upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) that the suspension has not been overturned on appeal. Following fall semester: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than two days prior to the first day of the spring semester Following spring semester: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than one week prior to the start of Summer Session II Following Summer Session: Upon notification to UREG (University Registrar) and no later than two days prior to the first day of the fall semester When warranted, the Dean is authorized to hold a suspension in abeyance and permit students who would otherwise be suspended to continue under specific conditions.\\xa0 After the semester has concluded, the student’s academic standing will be evaluated and the appropriate academic discipline, if required, will be imposed. Appeals from Students Students may appeal negative decisions about enrollment or general academic policies in the College.\\xa0 Students who believe there is a valid reason for requesting an exception to any of the rules should file a petition to their Association Dean.\\xa0 In many cases, the recommendation of a course instructor or advisor is required on the petition before it is filed.\\xa0 Only students may submit appeals on their own behalf.\\xa0 Any appeal must be made in a timely manner.\\xa0 Students whose petitions for exemption from College rules have been denied by the Association Deans may appeal to the Committee on Faculty Rules (c/o Monroe Hall 101).\\xa0 The Committee consists of faculty members who are not Association Deans and its decision is final.\\xa0 The procedure for grade appeals follows a different path and is discussed below (see the section on Grades).\\xa0 Students should consult with their Association Dean for details about how to appeal a particular decision. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List Full-time students who demonstrate academic excellence while taking a minimum of 15 credits of graded course work are eligible for the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Courses taken on a CR/NC basis are not counted toward the 15-credit minimum.\\xa0 A current minimum grade point average of 3.500 is necessary to be eligible for the Dean’s List.\\xa0 Students on approved reduced course load from the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC) who enroll in and pass 7 or more graded credits and earn a 3.500 GPA are eligible for Dean’s List.\\xa0 Any student receiving an F, NC, or U during the semester is not eligible to be on the Dean’s List.\\xa0 The notation “Dean’s List” is posted normally within several weeks after the conclusion of the semester. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa is the nation’s oldest and most prestigious undergraduate honors organization.\\xa0 For more than 200 years, the Society has pursued its mission of celebrating and advocating excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and its distinctive emblem, a golden key, is widely recognized as a symbol of academic distinction.\\xa0 Students are elected to Phi Beta Kappa for their scholarly attainment in the liberal arts and sciences.\\xa0 Undergraduate members of Phi Beta Kappa are chosen from the top 12 percent of the fourth-year class and the top 4 percent of the third-year class.\\xa0 Students must have earned at least 60 hours at the University of Virginia to be eligible; credits earned at other institutions are not counted in these computations.\\xa0 If you meet these basic criteria you are automatically considered, so it is not necessary to apply.\\xa0 Students chosen for Phi Beta Kappa not only have earned a high grade point average but also have consistently demonstrated scholarship in the liberal arts and sciences.\\xa0 Generally speaking, students elected will have: chosen courses that reflect a scholarly commitment to the breadth and depth of the liberal arts, demonstrated proficiency in challenging advanced-level courses, and carried a challenging course load (usually considered to be 14-15 credit hours most semesters). More specifically, nominees will have taken at least two courses in each of the following areas: humanities, social sciences, and the natural or physical sciences.\\xa0 They will also have taken at least one intermediate course in a foreign language and one course in college-level mathematics, logic, or statistics.\\xa0 All course work must be done in college or university (No AP credits fulfill the criteria).\\xa0 In sum, the students who are elected choose programs that have breadth, depth, and rigor.\\xa0 Extracurricular activities are not taken into account.\\xa0 We hope that students interested in being elected to Phi Beta Kappa will consider these criteria with their advisors as they select their courses throughout their years of study at the University.\\xa0 However, individual consideration is granted each transcript and election is determined by PBK faculty, not by a set of fixed criteria. Questions about Phi Beta Kappa or its University of Virginia chapter should be addressed to Michael F. Suarez, president or Karlin Luedtke, secretary. For general information visit the web site of the National Headquarters of Phi Beta Kappa: https://www.pbk.org Theses and Commencement Honors Degrees with distinction, high distinction, and highest distinction are awarded to students who have a grade point average of 3.400 or higher and have been recommended by the department or interdisciplinary program in which they have completed a Distinguished Majors Program (DMP).\\xa0 Distinguished majors programs require that students submit a written thesis.\\xa0 Most degree programs in the College of Arts & Sciences offer a distinguished majors program.\\xa0 In departments offering thesis courses, non-DMP students may have an opportunity to write a thesis; contact the specific department or program for more information.\\xa0 A degree with distinction (but not high or highest distinction) is awarded to students who have not enrolled in, or who have discontinued, a DMP but who complete their degree with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.600. College Curriculum All entering first year students, with the exception of Echols Scholars, must complete the Engagements Pathway detailed below.\\xa0 Entering second or third year transfer students complete the Traditional Curriculum.\\xa0 However, starting in fall 2025, transfer students will complete the Disciplines Plus Pathway.\\xa0 Students entering the College through transfer, as well as those who begin their Virginia community college studies this year, will be governed by the College curricular rules outlined in this year’s Undergraduate Record, so long as the student maintains continuous enrollment and enrolls at the University of Virginia within one year of completing their community college program and within four years of when they began their community college enrollment.\\xa0 The application of College curricular rules includes not only the general education pathway specified, but also the number of credits required for graduation (total credits, credits in residence, and credits in the College of Arts and Sciences) and GPA requirements.\\xa0 Transfer students will be governed by the major requirements in place at the time they declare their major, after arriving at the University.\\xa0 Following matriculation, all remaining Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum) must be completed at the University of Virginia and must be taken on a graded basis.\\xa0 AP credits from secondary school and transfer credits awarded before UVA matriculation may count toward the Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum), with the exception of the Second Writing requirement.\\xa0 Dual-enrollment credit may not be used to meet the First or Second Writing requirement nor the World Languages requirement. THE ENGAGEMENTS PATHWAY The Engagements pathway consists of three parts: the first year Engagement courses (8 credits); the Literacies (variable credits depending on placement); and the Disciplines (21 credits).\\xa0 For more information on these requirements, see https://gened.as.virginia.edu/requirements .\\xa0 Specific course offerings may be found in the Course Catalog and through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Engagements Students must take four 2 credit classes in their first year, one each of the following engagement classes. EGMT 1510: Aesthetic Engagement EGMT 1520: Empirical and Scientific Engagement EGMT 1530: Engaging Difference EGMT 1540: Ethical Engagement Students may choose from a variety of specific topics taught under each generic category and may take these courses in any order. Literacies Students must complete each of the following literacies: Rhetoric for the 21st Century , consisting of the First and Second Writing Requirements; World Languages ; and Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis .\\xa0 The Literacies provide the foundation for successful study in the liberal arts and equip students with the necessary skills and fluencies needed to succeed in a rapidly-transforming world. Rhetoric for the 21st Century: First Writing Requirement Students meet the first writing requirement by successfully completing one of the following five paths: By successfully completing the two-semester Writing and Critical Inquiry Stretch I & II, ENWR 1505/1506. Take this sequence if you scored 560 or below on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT or a 21\\xa0or below on the ACT English test. Students in this path should enroll in ENWR 1505 in the fall semester, to be followed by ENWR 1506 in the spring. By successfully completing the two-semester ESL sequence, Writing and Critical Inquiry Stretch I & II for Multi-Lingual Writers, ENWR 1507/1508.\\xa0 Note that this path is for students who are still developing their skills in English as a second language.\\xa0Students required to fulfill the first writing requirement in the ESL path will be identified by the Admissions Office, the Summer Transition Program, The Center for American English Language and Culture, or the Academic and Professional Writing Program. Students in this path should enroll in ENWR 1507 in the fall semester, followed by ENWR 1508 in the spring.\\xa0 Students who are not required to take this sequence but who wish to be considered if spaces are available should contact Claire Chantell for more information. By successfully completing Writing and Critical Inquiry, ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530. Students in this path (i.e., those scoring between 570 and 740 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing portion of the SAT or between 22 and 35 on the English portion of the ACT) should enroll in ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530\\xa0in the fall semester if the first letter of their last name is A through K. Students should also register for fall ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530 if they play on a varsity team that travels primarily in the spring OR if they are transfer students OR if they are repeating the course. Otherwise, students with last names beginning with L-Z should enroll in ENWR 1510, 1520, or 1530 in the spring semester. By successfully completing a First Writing Requirement Advanced course (ENWR 2510, 2000-level ENLT, or ENCW 2300 or 2600) and submitting an FWR-Plus form to the Writing Program office. This option is available only to students scoring a 740 or above on the SAT’s Evidence-Based Reading and Writing\\xa0test or\\xa0a 36 on the ACT English test. By enrolling in the Echols Scholars program. Courses taken to fulfill the First Writing Requirement cannot also satisfy the Second Writing Requirement or any Disciplines (or Area) requirement. Rhetoric for the 21st Century: Second Writing Requirement All students, except Echols Scholars, must complete at\\xa0UVA a second writing requirement course with a grade of C- or better.\\xa0 Second writing requirement courses are 3 or 4 credit writing intensive courses found in many departments across the College.\\xa0 A course in a school other than the College, advanced placement credit, advanced standing, dual enrollment credit, or credit transferred from another university will not satisfy this requirement.\\xa0 A course must have at least two writing assignments in English totaling 20 pages or more, exclusive of quizzes and final examinations, and a student/faculty ratio no greater than 30/1 to qualify as a second writing requirement course. Although it is not advised, a student may take a course that meets the second writing requirement before or during the semester that he or she completes the first writing requirement.\\xa0 However, completing the second writing requirement neither exempts a student from, nor fulfills, the first writing requirement.\\xa0 A course that satisfies the second writing requirement may simultaneously count toward a student’s major or minor program or toward a Disciplines requirement.\\xa0 A second writing requirement course may also count for up to two area requirements. A course that is not designated in the College Catalog as a second writing course may fulfill the requirement when an instructor certifies that the course meets the standards for a second writing requirement course noted above.\\xa0 In this case, a student must file a second writing requirement completion form along with a syllabus of the completed course.\\xa0 The College Registrar will forward the documentation to the administrative chair of the Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum for a final determination.\\xa0 The completion form is available online and in Monroe Hall. World Languages Language is not simply a means to communicate, but also an avenue for insights into other cultures.\\xa0 Many students also discover that learning a second language improves their understanding of English and broadens their awareness of an increasingly diverse America.\\xa0 Students can meet the World Languages requirement by successfully completing one of the following courses of action: Earn exemption by placing beyond the intermediate level (usually 2020) by examination Take four semesters of the same language (14 to 16 credits depending on the language) in the proper sequence typically finishing at the 2020 (advanced intermediate) level After placement, complete the remaining courses in the sequence up to the fourth semester (usually 2020) Placement in a language sequence is by SAT II Subject Test score, Advanced Placement (AP) Exam, Higher-level International Baccalaureate Exam, or a departmental placement test.\\xa0 Consult the World Language Placement Index ( http://college.as.virginia.edu/fl-placement-index ) for specific departmental standards.\\xa0 Students must follow the department’s recommendations in the completion of the World Languages requirement.\\xa0 Once placement occurs, the World Languages requirement is fulfilled by the completion of each course in sequence.\\xa0 Credit for introductory language courses is disallowed if it duplicates world\\xa0language credits offered for admission to the College. Students may be exempted from world languages not taught in the College upon certification by a faculty member or outside examiner designated by the College.\\xa0 Students diagnosed with a specific language learning disability should contact their Association Dean.\\xa0 The policy is outlined below in the Course Rules section. Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis The Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis literacy enables students to apply mathematical skills to understand and solve real world problems.\\xa0 Students fulfill this requirement by completing two courses (6+ credits) in qualifying courses in statistics, mathematics, data analysis or logic that address at least some of the following: Theoretical concepts and structures of mathematics and statistics including, but not limited to, pure mathematics, logic, and theoretical statistics. Manipulation and interpretation of mathematical expressions. Application of computational and analytical methods in order to manipulate, organize, summarize, and evaluate quantitative information and experience. Theoretical and/or practical interpretation and communication of data in order to solve real-world problems. These courses may be found in multiple departments across the College including Anthropology, Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics.\\xa0 Qualifying courses may be found through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Disciplines Disciplines courses provide students with a breadth of approaches to intellectual inquiry from across the College curriculum.\\xa0 Students must complete one course (3 or 4 credits each) from at least six different departments in each of the following seven categories. Artistic, Interpretive, and Philosophical Inquiry The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe Cultures and Societies of the World Historical Perspectives Living Systems Science and Society Social and Economic Systems Courses that fulfill each of the categories may be found across multiple departments and many courses count toward two different Disciplines categories.\\xa0 When a course counts toward two different Disciplines, students may choose which category the course fulfills.\\xa0 Qualifying courses may be found through the Class Search function in the Student Information System (SIS). Modification for the B.S. Degree Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program may elect to take 9 credits in one or two of the following three categories (rather than 3 credits in each): The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe, Living Systems, and Science and Society .\\xa0 They may double-count one course (3 credits) towards fulfilling two of the following three categories: Cultures and Societies of the World, Historical Perspectives, and Social and Economic Systems .\\xa0 The course in question must be listed in both categories for which it will count.\\xa0 Bachelor of Science students must fulfill the Disciplines requirement by taking courses in five different departments. The Disciplines Plus Pathway for Transfer Students (beginning in Fall 2025) Students in the Disciplines Plus Pathway complete the same Literacies and Disciplines as students in the Engagements Pathway.\\xa0 However, instead of taking the first year Engagements courses (8 credits total), students complete two\\xa0additional courses (6\\xa0credits) in the Disciplines beyond the seven required as follows: One additional course in Artistic, Interpretive, and Philosophical Inquiry One additional course in Cultures and Societies of the World OR Historical Perspectives OR Social and Economic Systems OR The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe OR Living Systems OR Science and Society Modification for the B.S. Degree Students enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program may elect to take 12 credits in one or two of the following three categories (rather than 3 credit in each plus an additional category requirement): The Chemical, Mathematical, and Physical Universe, Living Systems, and Science and Society.\\xa0 They may double-count one course (3 credits) toward fulfilling two of the following three categories: Cultures, and Societies of the World, Historical Perspectives, Social and Economic Systems.\\xa0 The course in question must be listed in both categories for which it will count.\\xa0 Bachelor of Science students must fulfill the Disciplines requirement by taking courses in six different departments. THE TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM Transfer students complete the Traditional Curriculum consisting of Competency and Area Requirements (but note the change above beginning in fall 2025).\\xa0 Competency requirements consist of the First and Second Writing requirements and the World Languages requirements listed above in the Literacies.\\xa0 Area requirements ensure that students have the background and breadth for further learning in a variety of disciplines.\\xa0 Students explore a wide range of disciplines, points of view, and modes of inquiry by earning the proper number of credits from courses taken in each of five different academic areas: Historical Studies, Humanities, Natural Science and Mathematics, Non-Western Perspectives, and Social Sciences. Historical Studies (3 credits) You must pass at least one course worth 3 credits or more either from the History Department or from a class determined by the faculty to be substantially historical.\\xa0 Qualifying courses can be found in the SIS Course Catalog.\\xa0 Courses taken to fulfill the Historical Studies Area Requirement may also count toward fulfilling one other Area Requirement.

Courses that count toward this requirement may be chosen from: The Departments of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics: all classes except EVSC 2030, 4030 and 4040, and MATH 1000T and 1030 Economics (ECON): ECON 3720 and 4720 only Psychology (PSYC): PSYC 2200, 3210, 3235, and 4200 only For this requirement, statistics, mathematics and the above two economics courses are considered to come from one department.\\xa0 Thus, students may not satisfy this requirement with courses in Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics solely.\\xa0 In addition, the Engineering School course, MSE 2010 is considered College-equivalent and may be applied to this requirement. Non-Western Perspectives (3 Credits) Students must pass at least one course worth 3 or more credits, which the faculty recognizes as dealing substantially with a culture other than Western culture.\\xa0 Qualifying courses can be found in the SIS Course Catalog.\\xa0 Courses taken to fulfill the Non-Western Perspectives Area Requirement may also count toward fulfilling one other Area Requirement. Social Sciences (6 credits) Students must pass at least one course worth 3 credits or more from two of the following departments and programs: Afro-American and African Studies (AAS); all classes except AAS literature courses Anthropology; except ANTH 2370 American Studies (AMST): all classes except AMST 2300 Economics (ECON): all classes except ECON 3720 and 4720 Environmental Sciences (EVSC): EVSC 2030, 4030, and 4040 only Environmental Thought and Practice (ETP): ETP 4810 only Global Development Studies (GDS): GDS 2020 Linguistics (LING AND LNGS): all LING and LNGS at or above the 2000-level Media Studies (MDST): MDST 3406 and 4200 only Politics (PLAP, PLCP, PLIR): all classes in Politics except Political Theory (PLPT) Psychology (PSYC): all PSYC classes except 2200, 3210, 3235, and 4200 South Asian Studies (SAST): SAST 2700 only Sociology (SOC): all classes except SOC 2600 Women, Gender and Sexuality (WGS): all WGS classes Course Rules Accuracy of Students’ Records Students are responsible for verifying the accuracy of their enrollment by the drop deadline, the withdrawal deadline, and each time they make a change in their schedule.\\xa0 Students who fail to do so are subject to various penalties as determined by the dean.\\xa0 Changes to the transcript are permitted only during the current semester and the immediately subsequent semester.\\xa0 Official transcripts may be requested from UREG (Office of the University Registrar) in Carruthers Hall.\\xa0 Unofficial advising transcripts, academic requirements reports, and final semester grades are available through SIS.\\xa0 Errors must be reported to the dean’s office within the stated deadlines; after one semester has lapsed, a student’s record is considered permanent. AP Credit If a course for which AP credits have been awarded is repeated at the University, the AP credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average. Changes in Schedule Changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS.\\xa0 If admission to a course requires the instructor’s permission, students should add their name to the instructor’s permission list and wait for an invitation to join the class.\\xa0 Note that being on a permission list does not guarantee that a student will be offered a space in a class.\\xa0 Students may add and drop courses through the deadlines stated in the current Schedule of Classes. Compliance with College Regulations Students are held responsible for selecting their courses in accordance with the course restrictions and policies printed in this Record, on the College of Arts & Sciences web pages, and in advising material distributed by departments.\\xa0 Only after the approval of the department and the\\xa0Dean’s office has been obtained in the form of a petition may a student enroll in a course that does not comply with the College’s regulations. Course Absence Regulations Regular attendance in classes is a vital part of the educational process.\\xa0 At the University of Virginia each student is expected to accept the responsibility of attending classes regularly and promptly.\\xa0 Instructors are encouraged to state their policy on attendance to their classes; they may refer any student whose attendance record they consider unsatisfactory to the dean. The Dean of the College will follow faculty requests to confer with students who are absent from classes too often and, when necessary, will impose academic discipline upon these students, either when recommended by instructors or deemed necessary by his or her office.\\xa0 Absences traditionally excused are those that occur because of hospitalization, serious illness, death in a student’s family, important religious holidays, or authorized University activities (field trips, University-sponsored athletic events, or the like).\\xa0 Students anticipating the need to be absent are expected to consult with the instructor promptly.\\xa0 The instructor is not obligated to allow students to make up missed work; it is the instructor’s decision, not the dean’s, whether students may be allowed such a privilege.\\xa0 Neither the Department of Student Health nor the dean’s office issues excuses for class absence or for missed quizzes.\\xa0 Only when students are unable to contact instructors themselves (e.g., debilitating illness, leaving town suddenly for family emergencies, protracted absences) do the Association Deans send notification to instructors; otherwise, it is the student’s responsibility to consult directly with the instructor regarding absence from class.\\xa0 Excuses for absences from final examinations must come only from the dean’s office. Course Enrollment Deadlines The College takes seriously all deadlines related to course enrollment.\\xa0 Students are responsible for being aware of the well-publicized dates each semester for adding, dropping or withdrawing from a course, or for changing the grading basis of a course.\\xa0 Students who miss these deadlines may be subject to enrollment penalties.\\xa0 Any student who wishes to appeal any penalty attached to missed deadlines must see their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students may not register late in the College and enroll in classes after the add deadline for the semester. Course Load Special permission is required to register for fewer than 12 credits or more than 18\\xa0credits each semester.\\xa0 With the exception of students who have SDAC approval, any\\xa0student who completes fewer than 12 credits incurs academic warning\\xa0(see Academic Standing above).\\xa0 Students who\\xa0enroll in no courses have their registration terminated.\\xa0 Students in their final semester prior to graduation whose petition for a reduced course load has been approved do not incur academic warning. Full time students enroll with the expectation of completing their degrees in no more than eight semesters, proportionally fewer if they enter as transfer students.\\xa0 When extenuating circumstances interfere, students may take up to nine full-time semesters with permission of their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students who fail to finish their degree programs in the allotted number of semesters allowed may complete their course work in the Summer Session, through part-time enrollment, or, with prior permission, at another accredited institution. Courses Taken at Other Institutions Students who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at the University should confer with\\xa0the dean and the relevant undergraduate\\xa0department that offers corresponding work at the University to confirm that classes will transfer.\\xa0 Permission is not granted unless students have at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average (2.500 for courses taken abroad).\\xa0 After matriculation at the University, students may not fulfill general education requirements with transfer courses, with the exception of world language courses taught in the target country.\\xa0 Courses taught in the UVA direct credit study abroad programs are accepted as University courses and students receive letter grades.\\xa0 Subject to the above, work completed elsewhere with a grade of C or better is transferred in credits only; letter grades do not appear on the University’s official records.\\xa0 Students will receive no more, and may receive fewer, than the number of credits earned at the host institution.\\xa0 Of the 120 credits required for graduation, at least 60 must be taken at the University of Virginia.\\xa0 Twelve or more credits attempted in a single semester for work at another institution, including at a foreign institution, will constitute one of the eight semesters allotted for full-time study in the College. Discontinuing a Course Students may not be removed from a course due to lack of skills or knowledge unless these requirements are identified in the course prerequisites.\\xa0 Students who decide to discontinue a course in which they have enrolled must use SIS to drop the course within the well-publicized deadlines.\\xa0 Students who fail to revise their list of current courses by using SIS within the deadlines become subject to penalties determined by the dean.\\xa0 Students who fail to appear for the\\xa0first class meeting and who have not made arrangements with the instructor are subject to disenrollment from the course.\\xa0 However, it is the student’s responsibility to drop the course via SIS by the drop deadline.\\xa0 After the drop period, students in the College may withdraw from a course in SIS with a grade of W until eight weeks from the first day of the semester.\\xa0 After this point, students must either complete the course or, with the instructor’s endorsement, submit a request for an incomplete to the dean’s office.\\xa0 Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure receive a failing grade. For year-long College courses, the deadlines to add and drop are those for the first semester, and the withdrawal deadline is that of the second semester. Dual Enrollment If a course for which dual enrollment credits have been awarded is repeated, the dual enrollment credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average.\\xa0 Dual enrollment credit may not be used to fulfill the literacies or the competency requirements. Exclusion From Classes A student who is making no real progress in a class, or whose behavior is detracting from the class, may be excluded from that course by the dean with a grade of W or F.\\xa0 Students have five calendar days following written notification of this exclusion in which to appeal.\\xa0 Until the final disposition of the appeal, the student is considered enrolled in the class. Graduate-Level Courses Undergraduates may not enroll in courses numbered 6000 and higher without the prior written approval of the Department and the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences or the corresponding School in the University.\\xa0 They must also receive approval from the College.\\xa0 Students use the “6000 Form”, available on the College website, to make a request for enrollment in these graduate courses. Independent Study and Interdisciplinary Courses Students who wish to do independent study must do so under the auspices of a Departmental or interdisciplinary degree program in the College.\\xa0 Interdisciplinary courses taught under the INST subject area count among the 12\\xa0non-College credits students may include in the 120 total credits required for a College degree.\\xa0 No more than three INST credits may count toward the degree. Intra-University or Non-College Courses Students are subject to the course enrollment deadlines of the School in which the course is being offered.\\xa0 As such, College students taking courses in other schools of the University must follow that School’s deadlines for dropping, adding, and withdrawing from a class.\\xa0 Similarly, non-College students must abide by the College’s enrollment deadlines when taking College courses.\\xa0 Non-College students who seek to withdraw from a College class after the College’s deadline are to consult with the dean of the School of their enrollment.\\xa0 The student remains in the class unless that Dean’s office authorizes a late withdrawal. For students offering the minimum 120 credits for the B.A. or B.S., at least 108\\xa0must be College (or College-equivalent) courses; thus, no more than 12 credits from other schools of the University may be applied toward the B.A degree.\\xa0 Elective courses in the schools of Commerce, Engineering, Education, Architecture, Leadership and Public Policy, and Nursing may count towards the 12\\xa0outside credits.\\xa0 College students may not take any courses from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and thus may not count any such courses toward their degree.\\xa0 By faculty approval, the following courses are considered College-equivalent and may be applied toward general education requirements:\\xa0ARH courses; ARCH 1010; MSE 2010; and PHS courses. The following courses may not count toward general education requirements\\xa0but are considered College-equivalent:\\xa0ARCH 1020; CS courses;\\xa0STS 3500;\\xa0USEM 1580 and 2580 (USEM 1570 and 2570 courses are non-College courses). The following courses may count as College equivalent courses only when a student completes the requisite program of study: PLAN courses below 5000 if the minor in Urban and Environmental Planning is completed; 12 credits of advisor-approved electives outside the College when a student completes the major in Global Studies with a concentration in Environments and Sustainability.\\xa0 Fourth-year College students who have been admitted to the Masters in Public Policy (M.P.P.) program in the Batten School of Public Policy and Leadership may count up to 12 credits of Batten School courses taken in the fourth year as College equivalent credits. Students in the special education track of the B.A.-M.T. Program are permitted to count the following additional six credits of Education\\xa0School courses as College-equivalent: EDIS 3020 or EDIS 5000 and one of the following courses: EDIS 5100, 5110, 5120, or 5150. In addition to courses taught by other schools in the University, the following are considered non-College courses and may not count toward the 108\\xa0College credits of the 120 credits total needed for the B.A.: all ELA and INST courses (only offered on a CR/NC grading option); all KINE courses; all KLPA courses; all PLSK courses; all ROTC courses–AIRS, MISC, NASC; all SEMS courses; all UNST courses; and all USEM 1570 and 2570 courses. Language Learning Disability Accommodations Following a diagnosis from the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC) and upon receipt of the coordinator’s recommendation, the student’s Association Dean may authorize the modification of the World Languages requirement and so notify the student in writing.\\xa0 Grades already earned in world language classes will continue to appear on the transcript.\\xa0 For the semester in which the requirement is modified, a failing grade will be converted to NC (no credit).\\xa0 Also, if a student is diagnosed with a language learning disability, a failing grade received in the semester when the student was referred to SDAC for testing, or the student with a prior diagnosis identified him/herself to the SDAC, will be converted to NC. If the withdrawal deadline has not passed, the student may withdraw thus receiving a W in the course. Therefore, a student experiencing exceptional difficulty in a world language class should: Consult immediately with the appropriate language course coordinator.\\xa0 The name of the coordinator may be obtained from the relevant world languages department. Undergo testing. Consult the Student Disabilities Access Center (SDAC), located in the\\xa0Student Health and Wellness building\\xa0and present either a prior diagnosis or discuss testing to be undertaken.\\xa0 The center will determine if a previous diagnosis was made according to acceptable standards and within three years of admission to the University or anytime thereafter.\\xa0 In the absence of an acceptable prior diagnosis, the SDAC staff will counsel the student regarding undergoing neuropsychological testing for the purposes of establishing a diagnosis.\\xa0 The SDAC will refer the student to approved testing agencies both within the University and the community. The student bears the cost of such testing. If a student has received a diagnosis of a learning disability deemed acceptable to the University’s SDAC and can document unsuccessful efforts to learn another language at an accredited institution, the student may confer with his or her Association Dean regarding modification of the foreign language requirement.\\xa0 A petition from the student will be reviewed by the College’s Disability Accommodations Committee. Request accommodation.\\xa0 If testing confirms a learning disability that adversely affects the learning of another language, the SDAC will suggest possible accommodations in the language classroom (e.g., extended time in class tests, de-emphasized oral or aural components, extra tutorial assistance).\\xa0 The student then takes the accommodation request to both the instructor and the language coordinator.\\xa0 The instructor and the coordinator will inform the student of the accommodations the student will receive in the class.\\xa0 The coordinator will notify the student’s Association Dean of the accommodations in writing.\\xa0 Ideally, accommodations should be in place prior to the student’s enrolling in the course. Enroll with accommodations.\\xa0 The coordinator reviews the student’s progress after six weeks. If the student is able to succeed, the student continues to take courses with accommodations until the foreign language sequence is completed. If the department finds that accommodations prove unworkable despite the student’s maximum effort, the coordinator may recommend in writing to the student’s Association Dean that the world languages requirement be modified.\\xa0 Modification is to be recommended only after proper accommodation procedures have failed. Substitute courses upon modification.\\xa0 The student will be required to take the appropriate number of substitute courses to fulfill the world languages requirement.\\xa0 These courses are to deal (in English) with the culture or literature of a non-English speaking people, or with the history or description of language.\\xa0 The substitute courses should form a cohesive cluster focussed on one language area, either continuing the work begun in the language class or choosing a new area.\\xa0 The substitute courses should be drawn primarily from world literature in translation courses (course mnemonic ending with TR, e.g.; CHTR, FRTR, GETR, ITTR, JPTR, PETR, POTR, RUTR etc.); classics (CLAS); those classes from anthropology, history, religion, or other departments that deal exclusively with a specific non-English speaking country or culture; or linguistics (LNGS).\\xa0 The student is to seek his or her dean’s prior approval for each substitute course.\\xa0 Substitute courses may not be applied toward the first major or toward either Disciplines or Area requirements.\\xa0 They may count toward the second writing requirement.\\xa0 All substitute courses must be taken for a grade. Maximum Credit Hour Limits To ensure breadth and depth in each student’s degree program, the following areas of study have restrictions on the number of credits that may be applied toward the B.A. degree: Dance Performance (DANC): 8 credits Interdisciplinary Studies (INST): 3 credits (and no more than two classes) Language House courses: 2 credits Music Performance (MUBD, MUEN, MUPF): up to 16 credits, if at least 8 credits are at the 3000 level and above (students completing a Distinguished Majors Program in Music may apply up to 20 credits) Personal Skills (PLSK): 2 credits Physical Education (KLPA, formerly KINE): 2 credits ROTC courses (AIRS, MISC, NASC): 12 credits University Seminars (USEM): 8 credits (only one course may be taken per semester) Part-Time Enrollment College students are ordinarily expected to be enrolled as full-time students.\\xa0 However, students may choose to enroll for a semester or two on a part-time basis.\\xa0 Part-time students are limited to a maximum of six credits per semester.\\xa0 Students may not count more\\xa0than 16 credits taken on a part-time basis toward the degree.\\xa0 College students registered full time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their enrollment to part-time status. Repeated Courses Two essentially different courses offered under the same course number may both be counted for degree credit upon the written recommendation of the director of undergraduate studies in the department concerned.\\xa0 Two essentially identical courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit.\\xa0 If a course is passed and repeated, only the first grade received is entered in the computation of grade point average.\\xa0 However, only the repeated course counts toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 Both the original and repeated course, and their grades, appear on the student’s transcript.\\xa0 If a course is failed and repeated, both courses and grades appear on the transcript, the repeated course with a passing grade counts toward the 120 credits, and both courses are computed in the grade point average.\\xa0 All Fs are calculated into the student’s grade point average. Simultaneous Counting of Courses and Cross-listed Courses A course that counts toward two Discipline\\xa0requirements may only satisfy one of those Disciplines for an individual student, but it may satisfy the Second Writing Literacy requirement.\\xa0 For transfer students in the Traditional Curriculum, one course may simultaneously meet two area requirements; it may also satisfy the Second Writing requirement. Courses taken to fulfill disciplines, area or second writing requirements may be counted toward a first or second major or toward a minor. Simultaneous Enrollments Students may not enroll in two courses that meet at the same time or that overlap in time.\\xa0 In the rare case where this is necessary, students must obtain the written approval of both instructors and their Association Dean.\\xa0 The faculty have the authority to require 100 percent attendance and participation in scheduled courses.\\xa0 The dean’s office, upon request from a faculty member, may disenroll a student, with a grade of W, from one of the courses. Transfer Credit If a course taken elsewhere and transferred to the University is repeated and passed at the University, only the credits awarded for the transferred course count toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 The course repeated at the University does appear on the student’s transcript, but the grade earned does not enter into computation of the grade point average, nor do the credits earned count toward the 120 required for graduation. Credit awarded as “X000T” credit will not count towards fulfillment of any general education requirements for entering first-year students.\\xa0 External transfer students may still apply X000T credit to fulfill area and competency requirements (literacies and disciplines requirements starting in fall 2025. Degree Information Bachelor of Arts The College offers a Bachelor of Arts degree\\xa0which provides students with a foundational liberal education of significant breadth and depth that allows students to pursue meaningful vocation, engaged citizenship, and intelligent self-development beyond their undergraduate years.\\xa0 The College has more than fifty different majors in the Arts, Humanities, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.\\xa0 The College also offers over thirty different minors.\\xa0 To earn a B.A. or B.S., a student must present 120 credits which satisfy general education requirements (see the section above on the College Curriculum), and the requirements for one major (see the section below on Majors and Minors).\\xa0 For specific information about each major and minor subject see the section “Departments/Programs” elsewhere in the College’s section of this Record.\\xa0 All of the requirements for the B.A. or the B.S. must be taken on a graded basis. Bachelor of Arts with Honors The purpose of the baccalaureate degree with honors is to enable students of special ability and interest in their third and fourth years to pursue a course of independent study under the guidance of a department faculty.\\xa0 Honors students devote their time primarily to their chosen subjects for two years, during which they read independently in that field and participate in tutorials and seminars conducted by their departmental tutors. Honors program students are evaluated by visiting examiners from other colleges and universities.\\xa0 Depending upon this evaluation, they may receive degrees with “honors,” “high honors,” or “highest honors” as the only grades for two years of work.\\xa0 It is also possible they may be recommended for no degree, or for an ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree.\\xa0 At present, the Woodrow Wilson Department of Politics is the only department with an Honors program.\\xa0 Further information may be obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Politics regarding its Honors program. Bachelor of Science The College offers a more rigorous Bachelor of Science degree for those students intending to pursue graduate study in one of the Natural Sciences or Statistics.\\xa0 The requirements for the B.S.\\xa0in Astronomy-Physics, Behavioral Neuroscience, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Physics, and Statistics are included in the appropriate departmental descriptions (see Departments and Programs). Curricular Requirements for Students Resuming their Education Students who discontinued their undergraduate education in the College and wish to resume it after a significant lapse of time are subject either to current curricular requirements or the general education curriculum in place when they matriculated to the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to current major requirements at the time of readmission to the College.\\xa0 The College\\xa0consults with the major department, determines the student’s remaining requirements, and informs the student of these requirements before readmission to the College.\\xa0 Students wishing to resume their undergraduate education should contact the College of Arts and Sciences Advising\\xa0Office in Monroe Hall. Degree Applications To receive a degree, students must comply with the well-publicized procedures administered by the College Registrar, whose office is in Monroe Hall 138.\\xa0 The application process for May graduation begins in October, with the final deadline to file a May degree application falling in December, before winter break.\\xa0 The application deadline for August graduation is July 1; for December graduation the deadline is October 1.\\xa0 Students who miss a deadline may apply for the subsequent graduation and must register for the semester in which it occurs. Degree Requirements For graduation from the College with a B.A. or B.S., candidates for the degree must have satisfied all general education and major requirements (see section above on the College Curriculum and the section below on Majors and Minors).\\xa0 Echols Scholars are exempt from general education requirements.\\xa0 In addition, candidates must have passed and offer for a degree a minimum of 120 credits of approved courses, of which at least 96 must be passed on a graded basis.\\xa0 Among the 120 credits, at least 108 must be College or College-equivalent credits.\\xa0 60 of the 120 credits must be taken at the University of Virginia.\\xa0 Candidates must have made a grade point average of at least 2.000 on all graded courses taken in the College or elsewhere in the University and offered for a degree.\\xa0 The College does not award second degrees.\\xa0 Students who earned a baccalaureate degree at UVA or at another institution are not eligible to receive a second undergraduate degree from the College. Echols Scholars Program About 250 accomplished students are invited to join the Echols Scholars Program at the time of their admission into the University.\\xa0 The program combines a stimulating residential environment with special academic advising for first-year students.\\xa0 Echols scholars are exempt from the College’s general education requirements.\\xa0 First-year Echols scholars and all Echols scholars who maintain a 3.000 or higher cumulative grade point average have priority registration for courses and the option of declaring an Echols major.\\xa0 Students with unusually strong academic records after their first year may apply for admission to the Echols Scholars Program.\\xa0 Professor Karl Shuve\\xa0is the Director and Dean Sarah Cole is the Assistant Director of the Echols Scholars Program. Eligibility and Completion of Degree Requirements Students in the College of Arts & Sciences, who, while studying elsewhere, declare a major there, are considered to have transferred from the University.\\xa0 If they seek to return to the College, they must apply as transfer students via the Office of Admission.\\xa0 Students who have completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree elsewhere may not enroll in a degree program in the College.\\xa0 A student who has received a baccalaureate degree cannot submit any courses offered for that degree toward another degree in the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to the general education requirements in effect during the academic year when they first enter the University.\\xa0 Students are subject to the requirements for the major in effect during the semester in which they declare the major. Posthumous Degrees Upon recommendation of the department in which the student was majoring, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may make a posthumous award of the degree the student was pursuing, if the student had earned at least 90 credits and was registered at the University within twelve months at the time of death.\\xa0 Eligibility for posthumous degrees extends to students enrolled in B.A. and B.S. programs. Residency Requirement The minimum residency requirement for a degree is two academic years.\\xa0 The last year of candidacy must be spent\\xa0at this University, and courses offered in the major for the degree must be completed at the University unless written permission is obtained from the department or interdepartmental program concerned. Time Frame for Degree Completion The expectation is that students complete a\\xa0degree program in four academic years/eight semesters of full-time enrollment (excluding Summer Session and January Term enrollment), proportionately fewer if they enter as transfer students.\\xa0 In order to remain on track to graduate in four years, students are expected to\\xa0have completed 54 credits to enroll in a fifth semester of full time study and 84 credits to enroll in a seventh semester of full time study.\\xa0 When extenuating circumstances interfere, students may take up to nine full-time semesters with permission of their Association Dean.\\xa0 Students who find themselves needing a ninth semester may consult with their Association Dean as early as the end of their fourth semester.\\xa0 Twelve or more credits attempted in a single semester for work at another institution, including study abroad, will constitute one of the semesters allotted for full-time enrollment\\xa0in the College.\\xa0 Students who fail to finish their degree programs\\xa0in the allotted number of semesters may complete their coursework in the Summer Session or January term, through part-time enrollment, or, with prior permission, at another accredited institution. Visiting Students With permission, students may be\\xa0admitted to non-degree, one-year enrollment as special students in the College.\\xa0 The purpose is to provide graduates of four-year institutions, with strong academic records, an opportunity to prepare themselves for graduate work in Arts & Sciences.\\xa0 This program is not meant for students who wish to apply to medical school, law school, business school or any other professional program of study.\\xa0 Written requests for admission as a special student should be addressed to Assistant Dean Mark Hadley, Monroe Hall 101, University of Virginia, P.O. Box 400133, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4133, and should be submitted by July 1\\xa0for admission for the fall semester.\\xa0 Such requests should include a letter of endorsement from the appropriate College\\xa0departmental graduate program director and an official copy of the student’s transcript. Special students are not accepted for the spring semester.\\xa0 No financial aid is available for visiting students. Admission as a visiting student does not imply or guarantee admission to a degree program in an undergraduate or graduate school of the University.\\xa0 Admission to undergraduate schools may be offered only by the dean of undergraduate admission.\\xa0 Admission to graduate programs may be made only by the dean of graduate admission of each individual graduate school. Final Examinations Final examinations are given in regularly scheduled courses during a designated period of time at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Final exams in courses may be given only at the times listed on the UREG (Office of the University Registrar) website.\\xa0 Examinations in courses not fitting the regular class times are scheduled by UREG in consultation with the instructor.\\xa0 Faculty members are not authorized to change the announced times of their examinations.\\xa0 Such changes may be authorized only by the dean’s office, and then only for compelling reasons.\\xa0 All students must have the opportunity to take the exam at the time announced on the UREG website. Students are not permitted to take a final exam before its regularly scheduled time.\\xa0 When a student has three exams scheduled over two consecutive days, the student may request a postponement of one of their exams.\\xa0 The student must file the exam postponement request, endorsed by the instructor of the course, no later than one week prior to the first day of the examination period.\\xa0 When other genuinely serious and extenuating circumstances exist, the Association Deans may authorize student requests, when endorsed by a faculty member, to reschedule a final examination either later in the exam period by filing an examination postponement form, or, by filing an extension of time form, to take the exam within four weeks after the exam period.\\xa0 These forms are available in the Office of the Dean of the College in Monroe Hall.\\xa0 Unexcused absence from a final examination results in an automatic grade of F in the course. Grades Credit/No Credit Grades Students have the option of receiving the grades CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of the regular grades A through F for a given course.\\xa0 This option is taken at the time the student registers for the course and no later than the add deadline.\\xa0 An instructor has the right to deny students permission to take his or her course on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 If this occurs, students may either change back to the regular grading option or they may drop the course entirely.\\xa0 Courses taken for CR/NC may not be used for any major, minor, competency or area requirements.\\xa0 It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor the minimum academic level of achievement for the grade of CR. No more than two courses may be taken on a CR/NC basis in any semester or in summer session exclusive of physical education courses.\\xa0 A maximum of 24 credits of CR/NC courses may be used toward a degree.\\xa0 Second-year transfer students are permitted to submit up to 18 credits of CR/NC work toward a degree; third-year transfer students, may submit a maximum 12 credits of CR/NC work.\\xa0 Students may not repeat a course originally taken on a graded basis on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 If this should occur, the credits in the CR/NC course would not count toward graduation.\\xa0 The deadline for selecting the CR/NC option is the same as the add deadline, and requests for exceptions to the deadline are seldom granted. Grade Appeals and Classroom Issues Students who wish to appeal a grade or other classroom issue must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course.\\xa0 Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student may appeal to the relevant department chair or program director.\\xa0 If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to a Committee of Associate Deans in the College of Arts & Sciences.\\xa0 The written appeal should be addressed to the Committee on Final Grade Appeals and mailed to or dropped off with the College of Arts & Sciences, Monroe Hall, P.O. Box 400133.\\xa0 Grade appeals may only relate to the process of how the final grade was computed and not the quality of a student’s work.\\xa0 Appeals of the grading process may result in a lower grade being awarded.\\xa0 Students have one term beyond when a grade posted to submit an appeal.\\xa0 The appeal of a grade from a course offered during a student’s final term before graduation must be appealed before graduation. Grade Changes No grade may be changed without the approval of the Dean after it has been submitted to UREG (University Registrar).\\xa0 The Dean is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to UREG (University Registrar) except when an instructor certifies that because of errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted.\\xa0 Extra work to raise a grade, once submitted, is not permitted.\\xa0 The College limits the time in which a grade change is approved to the fall or spring semester following the one in which the grade was received, except when there is indication that the student violated the integrity of the course. Incomplete An instructor may offer, with the dean’s approval, an extension of time for the completion of requirements in a course.\\xa0 However, instructors may not offer additional work to raise a grade once a final grade has been submitted to UREG.\\xa0 Unless authorized by the dean’s office, students must complete all course work before taking the final examination in a course.\\xa0 Students who are granted an extension of time have 4 weeks from the end of final exams to complete the remaining course work.\\xa0 If the remaining work is not completed, a grade of IN becomes an F\\xa030 days after the end of the examination period.\\xa0 Extension of Time forms are available in\\xa0Monroe Hall 101. Intra-University Transfers Transferring into the College Undergraduate students enrolled in other schools at the University may apply to transfer into the College.\\xa0 With very limited space in the College, Intra-University transfer into the College is not assured.\\xa0 Students seeking to transfer into the College may submit applications in either the fall or spring semester.\\xa0 Prospective transfers are encouraged to visit the College’s website for current and accurate information about academic policies and application forms: http://college.as.virginia.edu/ . Transfer Return to the College Students who have been accepted for transfer from the College to another school at the University, but wish to reverse the process and return to the College, may do so before the beginning of the new semester.\\xa0 Once the semester starts, they remain enrolled as students in the other school and must apply as an Intra-University transfer student.\\xa0 Accordingly, a student who completes one or more semesters in another school of the University and then wishes to return to the College must also apply as an Intra-University transfer student. Leaving and Returning to the University Entering Students Whose Medical Circumstances Preclude Enrollment Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in the College before the semester begins must return to the University via the Admission Office, either as a deferred admission or as a transfer student.\\xa0 Students deferred by the Admission Office may enroll in courses elsewhere with the permission of the Admission Office.\\xa0 Transfer students must complete at least 24 semester credits of college work prior to matriculation. Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in the College after the first day of the semester must withdraw from the University.\\xa0 They may return in accordance with College policy on re-admission.\\xa0 Students who withdraw from the semester may take courses elsewhere with the prior permission of the Office of the Dean of the College, and in accordance with College policy on transfer credit.\\xa0 All such course work will be accepted as elective credit only. Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Further Information on Withdrawal For further information about voluntary withdrawal, medical withdrawal, and enforced withdrawal please see the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 Students on financial aid should consult the Student Financial Services Office for additional information.\\xa0 Any questions about tuition and fees for withdrawn students should be directed to Student Financial Services as well. Leave of Absence The College expects students to register each semester and proceed to the completion of their degree programs.\\xa0 However, students may request to take a leave of absence, which is valid for up to two consecutive semesters.\\xa0 Students who plan to be away from the University in a subsequent semester (or semesters)\\xa0should file for a Leave of Absence no later than the day before the beginning of the semester the student plans to be on leave.\\xa0 Students may file for a Leave of Absence through the Student Information System (SIS). Students in the College who have been on an approved leave of absence apply for re-admission when returning to the University (see below).\\xa0 Students who enter a degree program at another institution, however, must reapply to the University as transfer students and are not guaranteed acceptance. Medical Withdrawal Due to significant medical reasons, a student may need to withdraw from the semester.\\xa0 A student may withdraw for medical reasons at any point in the semester, with the same conditions and restrictions applying as with a voluntary withdrawal (see below).\\xa0 In addition, students who return to the College after a medical withdrawal must be cleared by Student Health (see Readmission below).\\xa0 In very unusual medical circumstances, documented by a health professional, a College student who did not withdraw during the semester has one semester in which to petition for a retroactive medical withdrawal.\\xa0 If approved, all grades convert to W’s and the student is obliged to be absent for a full semester before resuming full-time study. Readmission Students should consult “Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University.\\xa0 Application for readmission must be made to and approved by the student’s academic dean in accordance with the College’s readmission deadlines and policies (see http://college.as.virginia.edu/readmission ). In addition to the requirements of the University’s policies governing readmission, students in the College returning after a fourth semester must also submit a signed Declaration of Major Form at the time of readmission, although students returning for their fifth semester may complete the Deferral of Major Form in place of the Declaration of Major Form, which is valid for one semester only.\\xa0 To be readmitted for a fifth semester, students must have earned a minimum of 54 credits.\\xa0 To be readmitted for a seventh semester, students must have earned a minimum of 84 credits. Students may file for readmission through the Student Information System (SIS).\\xa0 Students will be notified in writing of the College’s decision on readmission.\\xa0 For readmission following a medical withdrawal, students should also follow the steps outlined by the Department of Student Health: https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu// . Voluntary Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period,\\xa0if they meet the conditions stated in the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 A grade of W will be entered for each course in which the student was registered.\\xa0 However, students in the College of Arts\\xa0& Sciences who withdraw within 10 class days immediately preceding the final examination period are not permitted to re-enter the College for the succeeding semester nor to present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 Students who have received a withdrawal notation on their transcript for two consecutive academic terms (not including Summer Session or J-Term), regardless of the lapse of time between the two terms, may not apply for readmission to the University for one year and may not present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 Students initiate the withdrawal process with their Association Dean. Majors and Minors The faculty requires each student to examine one subject in depth to experience sustained, cumulative study of a range of related topics and issues over a period of several semesters.\\xa0 Study in a major allows students to focus on an area of interest where they would like to develop their intellectual capabilities.\\xa0 The faculty does not view the major as a direct path to a particular career.\\xa0 However, by developing a mastery of a particular area, students advance their intellectual capabilities in ways that will be of value in a range of later endeavors.\\xa0 The College also offers the minor in over thirty subject areas, but a minor is not required for completion of the B.A. or B.S. degree. For a listing of majors and minors in the College see: http://college.as.virginia.edu/degreeprograms. Concentrations Some departments and interdisciplinary programs offer concentrations along with the major.\\xa0 Students in these departments or programs may concentrate in designated areas of study that also meet the requirements of the major.\\xa0 Concentrations typically involve special topics, applications, or disciplines, and may include courses taken in other departments or schools of the University.\\xa0 A student’s concentration appears, along with the major, on his or her transcript. Declaring the Major Students must declare their major before the last day of classes in the fourth semester.\\xa0 The program must be approved by an official major advisor and the completed form must be returned to the College.\\xa0 Students who begin the fifth semester without either declaring a major or deferring declaration of a particular major for one semester will be blocked from enrolling in the next semester’s classes and may lose their enrollment place.\\xa0 No student may begin a sixth full-time semester without a declared major.\\xa0 Declaration of Major and Deferral of Major forms may be obtained on the College’s website and submitted electronically. Declaring a Minor Students intending to minor must complete the appropriate forms in the department or program no later than the add period of their next to last semester in the College (normally the seventh semester). A copy of the minor form may be found on the College’s website and may submitted electronically. Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the second writing requirement may simultaneously be offered in fulfillment of a minor, except that world language courses through the intermediate level may not be included as part of a minor, except the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean minors in East Asian Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. Distinguished Major Students who show exceptional promise in their major field of study may be eligible for admission to the Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) within their department.\\xa0 This program consists of at least twelve credits of advanced work and a thesis, special project, experiment, or exhibit based on at least six credits of supervised research, advanced laboratory work, or advanced study, as determined by the department.\\xa0 Successful completion of the program with a University cumulative grade point average of at least 3.400 will qualify a student for graduation with distinction, high distinction, or highest distinction. Interdisciplinary Majors A number of majors\\xa0are considered\\xa0interdisciplinary.\\xa0 These include American Studies; Archaeology; Bioethics;\\xa0Cognitive Science; East Asian Studies; Echols-Interdisciplinary; Environmental Thought and Practice; German Studies; Global Studies; Human Biology; Jewish Studies;\\xa0Linguistics; Medieval Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Neuroscience; Political and Social Thought; Political Philosophy, Policy and Law; South Asian Studies; Women, Gender, and Sexuality;\\xa0and a self-designed interdisciplinary major. Students completing an interdisciplinary major may submit up to three courses toward the completion of another major.\\xa0 However, both the sponsoring program for the first major and the sponsoring department or program for the second major must appove the sharing of courses for both majors. Students\\xa0who complete the Global Environments and Sustainability track within the Global Studies major may count up to 12 credits of advisor-approved electives outside the College as College-equivalent credit. Students wishing to focus on an area for which there is no departmental or interdepartmental major program may apply to the College for acceptance in the Interdisciplinary Major Program.\\xa0 Such a plan of study must include at least 30 credits of courses, in addition to a 6-credit thesis. The program must also be approved by three faculty sponsors, who will serve as the student’s major committee.\\xa0 Details are available in Monroe Hall. Major Course Restrictions All courses used to meet major requirements must be taken on a graded basis.\\xa0 Beyond the courses required for the major, however, a student may register for other courses in their major field on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the Second Writing Requirement may be offered in fulfillment of a first or second major.\\xa0 Courses applied toward the major may not be transferred from another institution to the University except with special permission of the department.\\xa0 Double counting of courses requires the permission of both major departments or programs. Credits applied toward a major may not be applied toward a minor. Major Subject The faculty requires each student to examine one subject in depth in order to experience sustained and cumulative study of this subject.\\xa0 Thus, all students must enroll in a major program of study offered by one of the departments or an interdepartmental program.\\xa0 The major program will have no fewer than 21 credits; it may also require up to 12 credits in related courses.\\xa0 Students may declare a second major in another department or program, in which case the application for a degree must be approved by both departments or interdepartmental programs.\\xa0 Students receive one diploma, but the double major status is reflected on their transcript.\\xa0 Students who double major must submit at least 18 credits in each major; credits applied toward one major may not be included in the core 18 credits of the other major, and no more than two courses can be counted simultaneously for two majors unless one or both majors is interdisciplinary (see above). Minors in the College As part of their undergraduate coursework, students may declare two minors minor offered by one of the departments or programs in the College.\\xa0 A minor consists of no fewer than 15 and no more than 24 credits of graded work in a program of study approved by a sponsoring department or program.\\xa0 Courses used to meet Disciplines\\xa0requirements in the College and the Second Writing Requirement may be offered in fulfillment of a first or second minor.\\xa0 Credits applied toward a minor may not also count toward completion of a major.\\xa0 College of Arts and Sciences students may declare a maximum of two minors; no more than one minor can be a non-College minor.\\xa0 As with the major, courses taken on a CR/NC basis may not be included in the minor program. Minors Outside the College Any student with no more than one minor in the College may also declare a minor in one of the other undergraduate schools in the University that allow College enrollment.\\xa0 However, students who declare a minor outside the College must keep in mind that courses taken in these schools count as non-College credits unless they have been approved as noted above as College-equivalent courses (see section on Course Rules). Courses taken for the Urban and Environmental Planning minor in the School of Architecture may count as College-equivalent courses only if the student completes the minor. Study Abroad The College encourages all students to study abroad.\\xa0 Students participate in study abroad according to the guidelines below; students interested in study abroad should consult the information available in the International Studies Office in Minor Hall, which handles all applications for study abroad.\\xa0 Further information is posted on its website: https://educationabroad.virginia.edu/ .\\xa0 Students should confer with their major advisor early in the process of selecting a Study Abroad program.\\xa0 Students may also consult with their Association Dean and with the Director of Undergraduate Programs in their major department. Eligibility Students must enroll for their first semester and at least one additional semester at the University in Charlottesville and complete no fewer than thirty credits before being eligible to study abroad.\\xa0 Thus, new students, either first-year or transfer, may not apply for study abroad until they have completed a regular fall or spring semester at UVA and are enrolled for their second semester; they may not begin the study abroad program until after completing their second semester, with the exception of J-Term study abroad programs.\\xa0 First year students who enroll in one of the UVA First programs, UVA London First\\xa0and UVA Valencia First, are exempt from this rule. To study abroad, students must be in good academic standing and have a cumulative GPA at UVA of no less than 2.500 at the point of application to study abroad.\\xa0 Any student who does not meet either criterion must submit a petition to his or her Association Dean to be considered for an exception to College rules.\\xa0 These standards apply both to direct-study programs and the traditional study abroad programs under auspices of another institution or organization.\\xa0 Participation in study abroad is on a competitive basis; acceptance may be based on criteria beyond minimum cumulative GPA. With approval of the student’s Association Dean and the major advisor, students may study abroad in their seventh or\\xa0eighth semester.\\xa0 Students who do so accept the risk of not graduating on time if their grades, for any reason, are not received by the deadline set by the College Registrar. Programs Students study abroad either in one of UVA’s direct-credit programs or in non-graded transfer credit programs sponsored by other institutions.\\xa0 In UVA direct credit programs, students enroll in UVA courses and receive grades. \\xa0These courses may satisfy general education, major, and minor requirements.\\xa0 In transfer credit programs, students enroll in programs sponsored by other institutions.\\xa0 Grades do not transfer, although courses must be passed with a C or higher for credit to be considered.\\xa0 Credit from transfer credit study abroad programs may not be used to satisfy general education requirements, with the exception of the world languages requirement, which may be fulfilled with approved course work in a country where the language is native.\\xa0 For transfer credit programs, the College strongly encourages students to select programs approved by their department and listed on the online database of programs maintained by the International Studies Office.\\xa0 Students in the College may transfer elective credits from these programs approved by ISO and listed on the transfer credit database maintained by the College.\\xa0 See http://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/AsEquivs .\\xa0 A maximum of 60 non-UVA credits from other universities, foreign study (the University’s direct-study programs exempted), advanced placement, or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. or B.S. degree in the College. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in UVA direct-credit programs are expected to meet the College’s longstanding criteria for good standing.\\xa0 Failure to do so will result in the academic sanctions of Academic Probation or Suspension.\\xa0 Students participating in semester- or year-long Study Abroad programs (not summer programs) are, like their full time counterparts in Charlottesville, expected to complete at least 12 credits each semester.\\xa0 Whether on direct credit programs or other approved programs, students who study abroad for a semester use one of the full-time semesters of full time study they are allotted. Transfer Credit The College grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended major and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the courses, and the accreditation of the institution at which the work was completed. Some transfer credit taken before matriculation may be used for fulfilling Disciplines (or area) requirements, or for fulfilling major requirements with special permission of the department.\\xa0 However,\\xa0credit awarded as “X000T” credit will not count towards fulfillment of any general education requirements\\xa0for traditional four-year students.\\xa0 External transfer students may\\xa0apply X000T credit to fulfill area\\xa0requirements (Disciplines requirements starting in fall 2025).\\xa0 External credit may also satisfy major requirements with special permission of the major department or program.\\xa0 However, dual enrollment credit may not be used to fulfill the Literacies general education requirements.\\xa0 All students in the College must take the second writing requirement in the College and earn a grade of at least C-. Current students must notify the College of their intent to study at an external institution by submitting a transfer credit request form prior to enrolling in courses for transfer.\\xa0 Transfer credit is allowed only for those courses in which a grade of C or better has been earned.\\xa0 Courses in which a grade of CR is received must be certified to be the equivalent of a grade of C or higher to be accepted.\\xa0 Only credits are accepted in transfer.\\xa0 Grades do not transfer and do not affect the student’s cumulative grade point average at the University of Virginia. Transfer credit is evaluated only for the degree program to which students are admitted, and the amount of credit awarded is subject to change if students change degree programs.\\xa0 In the College, the amount of transfer credit awarded and the number of full-time semesters previously completed determines class standing.\\xa0 Only 60 credits of transfer from other universities, foreign study, advanced placement, or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. or B.S. degree in the College.\\xa0 For more information, see the Transfer Credit section of the University Regulations. Advanced Placement (AP) Credit The College accepts College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Program by awarding advanced standing or advanced placement and in many cases transfer credit to entering students who have made specified scores on AP exams.\\xa0 For more information on transfer credit received based upon specific scores on various AP tests please consult the table found in the section on Admission in the general University section of this Record. International College-Level Examinations The College of Arts and Sciences grants advanced standing credit and advanced placement for qualifying examination scores in the Higher-Level International Baccalaureate, the French Baccalaureate, the British A-Level, the German Abitur, and select other examinations.\\xa0 We award advanced standing credit or placement based upon qualifying examination scores (and, where applicable, subject coefficients) and the recommendation of the appropriate Arts & Sciences department(s).\\xa0 Students who have taken the IB or British Advanced Levels are referred to the tables provided in the University section of this Record under the Admission webpage.\\xa0 Credit and advanced placement are generally determined on a case-by-case basis, on the student’s initiative, by the Dean’s Office in the College of Arts & Sciences and by the Director of Undergraduate Programs in the appropriate department(s).\\xa0 The College does not award credit based upon the length of study of a particular program.\\xa0 Since approved credit is advanced standing credit, not transfer credit, we base the award of credit solely upon examination results and not upon completed courses.\\xa0 The College does not award credit for foreign language subject examinations of English language or literature. Advanced standing credit is included among non-UVA credits on the student’s transcript and, along with transfer credit, is limited to a total of 60 credits.\\xa0 The College of Arts & Sciences and individual departments may limit the number of advanced standing credits awarded to an individual.\\xa0 Students may receive at least one, and not more than two, semesters of introductory-level credit per qualifying examination score.\\xa0 Departments have their own policies on the use of advanced standing credit for their major or minor requirements. To receive credit for other international examinations, students must provide an official copy of their examination certificate, including an official English translation if requested.\\xa0 The certificate should be sent directly to the College of Arts & Sciences, P.O. Box 400133, Charlottesville, VA 22904-4133, or delivered in-person in a sealed envelope.\\xa0 Students must be prepared to provide to the departmental undergraduate directors official course descriptions, syllabi, and copies of examinations.\\xa0 We encourage students to contact us and the appropriate Director of Undergraduate Programs if they have questions about receiving advanced standing credit or advanced placement for any of these examinations.\\xa0 A list of the names of the Directors of Undergraduate Programs and their emails and telephone numbers is located on the College of Arts & Sciences website.

Prospective students at other colleges or universities who wish to transfer to the McIntire School should consult the http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid=52&navoid=4102#McInt_Scho ol\\xa0section as the prerequisites differ slightly. Deferring Admission A student admitted into the Bachelor of Science in Commerce may petition to postpone enrollment in the McIntire School due to extenuating circumstances. Requests to defer an offer of admission will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are not automatically granted. Rescinding an Offer of Admission It is the McIntire School’s expectation that all applicants uphold the intellectual, ethical, and professional standards of the School and the University of Virginia. By applying to the School, students agree to abide by the principles of the UVA Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct. The School may rescind an offer of admission up until the date matriculation for, but not limited to, the following reasons: An applicant fails to successfully complete any program prerequisites; An admitted applicant fails to show satisfactory academic progress in any courses completed after receiving their offer of admission; An applicant is found to have presented misleading or fraudulent information during the application process; An applicant fails to follow the principles the Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct described above. Academic Advising All new incoming students are assigned an Academic Advisor from the Office of Student Services and Academic Operations. These advisors support students’ navigation of the general Commerce curriculum including concentration and track requirements, course enrollment and selection, and final degree completion. Students are ultimately responsible for their academic schedule and degree requirements. Academic Standing Academic Probation A student will be placed on probation for the following fall/spring term if he or she: passes fewer than 12 credits; OR earns less than a 2.000 grade point average in any fall/spring semester; OR carries fewer than 15 credits of graded work per semester without permission. A student on probation shall retain such status for one semester and must achieve a 2.0 semester grade point average to be removed from probation. Students are not removed from probation by attending summer school. Students placed on probation for work completed in the fall/spring semester preceding graduation will not be allowed to graduate. Suspension Suspension involves enforced withdrawal from the University and may be issued whenever a student: passes fewer than nine credits or earns less than a 1.800 grade point average in one semester; OR incurs probation for two consecutive semesters; OR incurs probation after a suspension. Suspension normally lasts for one academic year; one full fall term and one full spring term must elapse before the student may request readmission to the University. Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree. Readmission is not automatic and students are encouraged to meet with the Associate Dean for Student Services and Academic Operations of the McIntire School to determine appropriate goals to be achieved while suspended. Application for readmission is considered upon presentation of evidence that the difficulties that led to suspension have been overcome. The application for readmission is to be submitted to the Undergraduate Program Rules Committee through the Associate Dean by March 1 for the fall semester and November 1 for the spring semester. A second suspension is final; no student who is suspended a second time will be readmitted. Appeals from Students Request for Exception to the Academic\\xa0Rules Committee\\xa0- Petitions Students may appeal/request exceptions\\xa0to the stated rules and regulations of the Commerce\\xa0School with regard to enrollment, grades, or other general academic policies. Students who believe there is a valid reason for requesting an exception must petition the Undergraduate Program Committee. Petition decisions are subject to the discretion of the Undergraduate Program Committee and are final once communicated in writing to students. If the outcome of a petition could alter a student’s academic status (e.g., academic probation or suspension), students must submit petitions at least 10 days prior to the start of the next full academic term (fall/spring). Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List Students who pass at least 15 credits of graded work in the semester with a GPA of 3.75 or above will be placed on the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students. Courses taken on a CR/NC basis may not be counted toward the 15-credit minimum. Any student receiving an F or NC during the semester is not eligible to be on the Dean’s List. Diploma with Distinction Diplomas inscribed with “distinction” are awarded to undergraduate Commerce students who have a cumulative grade point average of 3.8 or higher based on all graded coursework completed while enrolled in McIntire. Curricular Requirements It is the philosophy of the McIntire School of Commerce that students should be broadly educated to deal with the complex issues of the business community and society at large. The school’s program is designed to increase students’ skills and build upon previous knowledge. In order to effectively achieve program goals, the school requires that students be enrolled full-time for two academic years and complete a minimum of 57 credits. Students are also required to complete all core, concentration, and elective Commerce courses at the McIntire School of Commerce or via an approved McIntire study abroad program. In addition, students must earn a minimum of 60 credits at the University of Virginia. A degree program must be completed in four academic semesters. Exceptions to this policy must be submitted to, and approved by, the McIntire Undergraduate Program Committee. Students in the third-year curriculum are required to be enrolled in 15 graded credits their first semester. A student may register for three more credits than were passed the preceding semester, up to 21 total credits. Fall Integrated Core courses (COMM 3010, 3020, and 3030) serve as prerequisites for spring courses (COMM 3040 and COMM 3050) and all fall courses must be successfully completed (i.e. earning a passing grade) in order to enroll in spring core courses. Course Rules Attendance Students are expected to attend all lectures and other prescribed activities of the courses for which they are registered. Although the course instructor sets course attendance requirements, any student who is absent from more than 50 percent of the lectures may automatically receive a grade of F in that course. Consistent with the UVA Undergraduate Record, unless otherwise notified by the instructor, students enrolled in all Commerce School undergraduate classes are required to attend every scheduled class and to arrive on time prepared for the class. If you are unable to attend class for any reason, you must notify your instructor in advance of the class. In courses where class participation represents a portion of the course grade, the instructor has complete discretion to assign the class participation grade that s/he decides is appropriate. Faculty may drop students from their class with notification who are not in attendance on the first day of the semester. Audio and Video Taping and Distribution of Class Materials The general policy of the McIntire School is to prohibit audio and video recording of classroom lectures and discussions. Audio and video recording are only allowed under special circumstances (e.g., students with documented disabilities) and only with the prior written permission of the instructor. Any audio or video recording or all other class materials handed out in class or posted to websites such as Blackboard, or Collab may not be exchanged or distributed for commercial purposes, for compensation, or for any other purpose other than study by students enrolled in the class. Public distribution of such materials may constitute copyright infringement. Unauthorized use of class notes or recordings may subject an individual to University Honor, Judicial charges, and/or legal action. Changes in Schedule Typically students have two weeks to add and drop courses after the start of the semester. Add/drop/withdrawal changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS. Commerce students may withdraw from non-Commerce courses\\xa0though SIS\\xa0based upon University deadlines and Commerce hour requirements.\\xa0\\xa0Students may not withdraw from 3000- or 4000- level Commerce courses. Course Completion Commerce students may not take 4000-level COMM courses prior to satisfactory completion of the fall Integrated Core Experience (ICE, or COMM 3010, COMM 3020, and COMM 3030) except with instructor permission.\\xa0 Non-Commerce students may not take 3000- and 4000-level COMM courses prior to their third or fourth year, except for COMM 3410, GCI courses, and other courses restricted to non-COMM students. Course Restrictions Courses taken on a Credit/No Credit basis and any courses offered through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies do not satisfy any McIntire degree requirements. Exclusion from Classes Any student who is making no real progress in a course may, at any time during the semester, be excluded from the course (with a grade of F) by the Dean upon recommendation of the course instructor. Repeating Courses No courses can be repeated except as specified in the University Regulations on Repeated Courses in the Undergraduate Record. Repeated courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. Degree Information Credit Requirements Students must earn 120 credits for the Bachelor of Science in Commerce. Of these: 48 credits must be in Commerce courses, including: 9 Prerequisite Credits: COMM 1800, COMM 2010 and COMM 2020 3-6 COMM Elective Credits 9-12 Concentration Credits 24 ICE & COMM Law Credits 57 Non-Commerce Credits 15 credits may be in either Commerce or non-Commerce courses. Students must earn 120 Total Credits (60 plus credits must be taken at UVA, plus 57 credits taken after enrollment at McIntire) 3rd Year: Must be enrolled in a minimum of 15 graded credits each semester. 4th Year: Must be enrolled full time a minimum of 27 graded credits. Any student carrying fewer than 15 credits is not eligible for the Dean’s List. Grade Requirements Students must achieve at least a 2.000 grade point average for: all course work completed; all course work within the concentration; all Commerce courses; course work taken during the semester immediately preceding graduation. This semester must be completed in good academic standing (see Academic Standing). Final Examinations Students are not permitted to take a final examination before its regularly scheduled time. When genuinely serious conditions exist, students, with consent of the course instructor and approval of Dean’s Office, may be allowed to postpone a final examination until later in the exam period or after the regular exam period. Customarily, McIntire has allowed students faced with exams in three consecutive periods to take one of them at an alternative time. Unexcused absence from a final examination results in an automatic F in the course. Grades Audit Commerce courses may not be taken on an audit basis. Credit/No Credit Grades After enrollment in McIntire, both degree seeking and non-degree seeking students, may only take courses CR/NC on an overload basis (i.e., above the minimum semester graded course load requirements – 15 per semester 3rd year and 27 total 4th year for degree seeking students). CR/NC classes may not be used to satisfy any McIntire requirements except the 57 non-Commerce requirement and the 120 total hours required for graduation. Commerce courses may not be taken on a CR/NC basis, except in the rare case when a Commerce course section is offered only as a credit/no credit grade for all students enrolled in that section. Grade Appeals Students wishing to appeal a grade in a Commerce course must first try to resolve the issue with the course’s instructor. That appeal must be in writing and submitted to the instructor at least two weeks prior to the start of the next full academic term (fall/spring). Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student may submit a written appeal to the McIntire Grade Appeals Committee (MGAC), who will review the matter and make a final decision on the appeal’s status. Appeals to the MGAC must be submitted at least five business days before the next full academic term starts (fall/spring). Course grades can be appealed for the following reasons: error in grade calculation, error in transcribing a grade in the Student Information System, or deviation from the grading practices stated in the course syllabus. Students who have questions about the grade appeal process or who wish to discuss any classroom issue may contact the Associate Dean for Student Services of the McIntire School. Grades cannot be changed after a degree is conferred. Grade Changes No grade may be changed after it has been submitted to UREG (University Registrar) without the approval of the Dean. The Dean is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to UREG (University Registrar) except when an instructor certifies that, because of errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted. Instructors must submit grade change forms via the Student Information System (SIS). Grades cannot be changed after a degree is conferred, or more than one semester following the end of the course, whichever comes first. Incomplete The notation IN (incomplete) is used when additional course work is required or examinations need to be taken in order to fulfill the requirements of the course. A student may not request an IN in an attempt to raise his or her grade. An IN automatically becomes an F thirty days after the final examination date, unless work in the course is completed satisfactorily within that time or arrangements have been made with both the Associate Dean for Student Services and the instructor for work to be made up later. Withdrawals Typically students enrolled in the McIntire School of Commerce have two weeks to add and drop courses after the start of the semester. Students may not withdraw from 3000- and 4000-level Commerce courses. Withdrawal from 1000- and 2000-level Commerce courses is allowed based upon University deadlines (typically eight weeks from the first day of the semester) and hour requirements. Commerce students may withdraw from non-Commerce courses through SIS based upon University deadlines and Commerce hour requirements. Add/Drop/Withdrawal changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS. Intra-University Transfers Transfer Back to the College Students who have been accepted for transfer from the College to McIntire School of Commerce that wish to reverse the process and return to the College, may do so before the beginning of the semester. Once the semester starts, they remain enrolled as students in McIntire and apply as an Intra-University Transfer student. A student who completes one or more semesters at McIntire and then wishes to return to the College\\xa0must apply as an Intra-University Transfer. Leaving and Returning to the University Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Students who are forced to withdraw during a given term will have the notation “Withdrawal Date: MM/DD/YYYY” entered on their permanent academic records following the semester in which the action occurred. A grade of W (withdrawal) will be entered for each course in which the student was registered. Students who have been forced to withdraw must apply for readmission to their dean’s office in the same manner as suspended students. A grade of W cannot be changed. Leave of Absence Upon successful completion of any semester in the McIntire School, a Commerce student may take a leave of absence for a one year or two years by meeting with the Associate Dean for Student Services and Academic Operations and filing a leave of absence request.\\xa0 Students taking such leave may normally return only in the academic semester that follows the last completed semester (e.g., a student who takes a leave after the fall semester, third year, must enroll in third-year courses in a subsequent spring semester). In order to leave, withdraw, or transfer, students must complete the “Leaving the University” (Leaves, Withdrawals, and Transfers) form which can be found on the SIS\\xa0Student Self Service page in a box on the lower right titled eForms. Medical Withdrawal Applications for withdrawal for medical reasons must be made in writing to the Undergraduate Program Committee (UPC) prior to the last day of the final exam period of the semester in which a student is requesting a withdrawal. Requests to withdraw must be approved by UPC prior to a student leaving the university and are final after communicated in writing to the student. If approved for a withdrawal, students then complete the SIS Leaving the University form to finalize the withdrawal process. Once finalized by UREG, a grade of W (withdrawal) will be entered for each course in which the student was registered. Generally, students must take the following semester off before returning to the University (e.g., student who withdraw from the fall semester, may be eligible to return the following fall semester.) Subsequent medical\\xa0review and recommendation\\xa0from the Department of Student Health and Wellness is required for readmission. A grade of W cannot be changed. Readmission Students who wish to return to the University after a suspension, a withdrawal, or an unapproved absence from the University must be formally readmitted to their last school of enrollment. Applications for readmission are not guaranteed. Any student seeking readmission and who intends to participate in enrollment for the next semester must submit a\\xa0Returning to the University\\xa0request to the Associate Dean for Student Services and Academic Operations of the McIntire School by March 1 for the fall semester and November 1 for the spring semester. Applications will be accepted until the UVa deadline of July 1 for fall and December 1 for spring. Students who have received a withdrawal notation on their transcript for two consecutive academic terms (not including Summer Session or J-Term), regardless of the lapse in time between the two terms, may not apply for readmission to the University until two semesters have passed (i.e., one fall and one spring). Once formally approved by McIntire, students must submit an eform in SIS to formally request readmission to UVa. For more information, consult the Returning to the University guidelines in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission at the University. Applications must include a statement from the student that (1) addresses the student’s readiness to return to the University in light of any serious difficulties during his/her most recent enrollment (e.g. financial, medical, personal hardship), and (2) outlines the student’s academic plan for his/her remaining semesters. Readmission depends upon a student’s status at the time of leaving the McIntire School. Students taking such leave may normally return only in the academic semester that follows the last completed semester (e.g., a student who takes a leave after the fall semester, third year, must enroll in third-year courses in a subsequent spring semester). Students having at least a 2.0 average in the McIntire School, who are making satisfactory progress toward their degree, may return in the appropriate semester as stated above. Students with less than a 2.0 average or who have not been making satisfactory progress toward their degree (e.g., they have not completed or passed courses required at the level attained when they requested the leave of absence) may be required by the Associate Dean for Student Services of the McIntire School to attend the University’s summer session to take prescribed courses before re-enrollment. Applications for readmission must be approved by the student’s academic dean, the Department of Student Health (if applicable), the Office of Student Financial Services, and the Office of Care and Support Services. Voluntary Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester with the following conditions: Students under the age of 18 must give notice to their parents or legal guardians of their intention to withdraw. Evidence of this notice must be provided at the time of withdrawal. Applications for withdrawal must be made in writing to the student’s Academic Dean’s office and must be approved by the Dean. Undergraduate students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period. Student may specify on the “Leaving the University” form whether their request to withdraw is for medical reasons. Students approved for withdrawal for medical reasons will need medical review from the Department of Student Health before they will be approved for readmission to the University; this medical review may take up to three weeks in addition to any deadline set by their school, so students should apply as early as possible when they wish to return to the University. Students who withdraw from the University voluntarily will have the notation “withdrew (date)” recorded on their permanent academic record. Students who withdraw will receive a grade of W in their courses. A grade of W cannot be changed. In order to leave, withdraw, or transfer, please complete the “Leaving University” (Leaves, Withdrawals, and Transfers) form, which can be found on the SIS Student Self Service page in a box on the lower right titled eForms. A student who withdraws for reasons of ill health must obtain medical clearance from the Department of Student Health prior to re-enrollment. A Commerce student who withdraws during the first semester in the McIntire School (fall semester, third year) will not be guaranteed readmission\\xa0to the school. Majors and Minors Concentrations Students may concentrate in two disciplines, in which case the requirements for both must be satisfied.\\xa0 Generally, a single course may not be counted simultaneously for credit in dual concentrations.\\xa0 However, students concentrating in finance and accounting may count COMM 3110 toward satisfying requirements for both concentrations.\\xa0 However, the credits may not be double counted toward the 120-credit degree requirement.\\xa0 The McIntire School of Commerce, due to resources, can guarantee the fulfillment of only one concentration, but will work to assist students wishing to pursue dual concentrations.\\xa0 There is no triple concentration. Students must maintain a 2.0 grade point average in all concentration courses. Any Global Commerce Immersion (GCI) concentration course taken prior to enrollment may count toward the concentration and Global Commerce Track but will not count toward the 39 Commerce credits after enrollment. Major/Minor Commerce students may pursue one major and/or one minor in\\xa0the College of Arts & Sciences or other UVA school outside of Commerce. Students may not declare two minors, but they may declare a major and a minor.\\xa0Prior permission must be obtained from the Chair or Director of undergraduate programs of the department in which the student is seeking the major or minor. In pursuing the above, students do not receive two degrees from the University. They receive a B.S. in Commerce.\\xa0 Concentration, major\\xa0and/or minor\\xa0status is reflected on student transcripts. Students are responsible for completing the major or minor form from the appropriate department and for obtaining the signature of the chair or director of that program. Forms must be submitted to the Registrar of the McIntire School, who monitors the satisfactory completion of requirements. Commerce courses may not be used to satisfy requirements for more than one major or minor within the Commerce School. Tracks A track is a specialty area of study crossing over multiple disciplines. Courses taken to satisfy track requirements can also be used to satisfy concentration, minor, or major requirements. Commerce students may complete up to two tracks if course scheduling allows this flexibility. Due to resources, the McIntire School cannot guarantee the fulfillment of tracks. Students must maintain 2.0 grade point average in all track courses. Study Abroad To study abroad in a Commerce course or program, students must be in good academic standing and have a cumulative GPA at the University of no less than 3.000 at the point of application to study abroad.\\xa0Application to study abroad does not guarantee placement; acceptance may be based on criteria beyond minimum cumulative GPA. \\xa0Commerce students wishing to apply to a semester abroad program must meet with a McIntire Global Programs advisor within Student Services and Academic Operations for academic advising. A wide range of programs exists that allow students to study abroad for a full semester and satisfy Commerce degree requirements. Students may study abroad in the spring semester of the third year or either semester of the fourth year; students are not allowed to study abroad in the fall semester of the third year. Students who do so in the spring semester of their fourth year should be aware that graduation may be delayed pending the transfer of credits. Regardless of timing, students completing a semester abroad program must be enrolled full-time at the host university (third year students: at least 15 credits; fourth year students: at least 12 credits). Courses taken at the host university must be taken for a grade and be pre-approved for transfer credit. Grades in courses transferred for Commerce credit will be converted if necessary from the original grading system, appear on the University transcript\\xa0and count toward the cumulative GPA. Students may transfer courses that fulfill concentration (up to 3 credits per concentration) or track requirements with prior faculty review and approval. Study abroad courses not transferred for Commerce credit must be passed with the equivalent of a C or higher to earn transfer credit. Transfer credits from no more than one McIntire-approved semester abroad program will be included in the McIntire 57-credit residency requirement. In addition, all students must fulfill the University’s residency requirement (i.e., at least 60 credits on Grounds at the University). Third year students may satisfy spring core course requirements (i.e., COMM 3040 and 3050) as follows: An additional 3 credit hours per concentration must be taken from an approved list either at the host university during the time abroad (if available) or at McIntire during the fourth year. At least 9 of the 15 credit hours taken at the host university must be upper-division business courses that do not duplicate the fall core courses. Those business courses approved to be transferred, but not applying toward a concentration will be transferred as general business electives. Global Commerce Immersion (GCI) short-term McIntire-led courses may also satisfy a concentration or track requirement but do not count toward the 39\\xa0Commerce credits minimum requirement if taken during the first or second year. (Further restrictions are noted on the Course Planning Guide.) Transfer Credit Credit toward a degree is allowed for approved work completed in another college or university upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of record. The School of Commerce grants transfer credit based on an analysis of the content, level, and comparability of the courses taken, the applicability of the courses to the student’s intended major and degree program, the quality of the student’s performance in the course, and the accreditation of the institution at which the course work was completed. However, no credit will be given for a required upper-level Commerce course unless the course is taken in the McIntire School or an approved McIntire study-abroad program. In no case will the total transfer credit granted toward a degree in the McIntire School of Commerce be more than 63 credits. Students must earn a minimum of 60 credits at the University of Virginia. No adjustment of transfer credit for prior course work will be made after the first semester in the school. (See Transfer Credit in the University Regulations section.) Students wishing to transfer credit for course work taken after enrollment in the school must receive prior approval from the Registrar. Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree.\\xa0(See Suspension) In general, credit will not be granted for: work completed with grade lower than C; business courses beyond the elementary courses in accounting and principles of economics; or more than one credit of physical or health education courses.

Admission Requirements Academic Advising Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence Certificate Programs Community Scholar Course Rules Curricular Requirements Degree Information Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Admission Requirements Admission Information about undergraduate degree and certificate programs offered by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is in the Record and on the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website: www.scps.virginia.edu Students should consult with Admission Services in SCPS if they have questions on the admission process or see Admissions on the SCPS website for further information: http://www.scps.virginia.edu/admissions Application of SCPS Courses to Degree Programs With the approval of the student’s school of enrollment, a course taken through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may be counted toward degree requirements. These courses would typically be included in the computation of grade point averages. Students should seek approval in advance; otherwise such courses may not apply toward a degree. Academic Advising Advising Providing advice related to academic matters and student services is an important element of all SCPS degree and certificate programs. Students are responsible for consulting with their advisors or program coordinators each semester before enrolling in courses. Academic Standing Academic Warning Students may incur academic warning during any fall/spring/summer semester in which they fail to meet the minimum academic standards defined by SCPS degree or certificate programs. These standards include any of the following: earn grades at the required level meet a certain grade point average in a given semester maintain a cumulative grade point average at a specified level earn enough academic credits in a given semester Suspension The conditions that lead to students being suspended from the University as a result of their academic performance vary by school. Students should consult SCPS Departments/Programs in this Record for details related to minimum academic standards for the degree programs. See Certificate Programs\\xa0section below related to minimum academic standards for Certificates. Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree from the University. Suspended students may apply for readmission to SCPS after one calendar year from the effective date of the suspension. Students who are readmitted after being suspended must meet the minimum academic standards as defined by their specific SCPS degree program or face a second academic suspension. A second academic suspension is final. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the class. Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student consults with the program’s senior program director.\\xa0 If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to the Associate Dean for Academic Programs.\\xa0 The associate dean’s decision is final.\\xa0 At each stage of their appeal, students should provide any supporting documentation they believe is important to their appeal. Appeals must be initiated within one month of the final date by which grades are posted for the term in question. Other Academic Grievances Students who have a grievance related to a course, with a faculty member, or related to the services provided by SCPS faculty or staff should pursue the grievance as follows: The grievance should be filed with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs, who will adjudicate the case. If this unit head is a party to the case or is otherwise unable to serve, the grievance should be filed with the school’s dean. The SCPS unit head will initially investigate the complaint. Investigation will include but is not limited to reviewing relevant documentation and meeting with the student and the faculty member or University official who made the decision being contested. Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the grievance, the SCPS academic unit head will\\xa0communicate in writing her/his recommendation to both the student and the faculty member or official. Awards for Academic Excellence Awards for Academic Excellence Please see the B.I.S. and BPHM degree program sections in this Record . Certificate Programs Certificate Programs The School of Continuing and Professional Studies offers programs in specialized fields such as business, government, healthcare,\\xa0and other professions that lead to the award of certificates. Generally, certificate programs require 12 to 24 credits of instruction. Admission requirements for undergraduate certificate programs include an on-line application, an application for Virginia In-State Education Privileges, and payment of the application fee. Only courses completed with a grade of C or better will count towards meeting the requirements of an undergraduate\\xa0certificate. Time to Completion for Certificate Programs Based on the type of certificate (credit or noncredit professional) and number of credits, SCPS certificate programs are to be completed by students in the following timeframes: Two years to complete a noncredit professional certificate program; Three\\xa0years to complete\\xa0a credit-bearing\\xa0certificate program with 18 or less credits; and Five years to complete a credit-bearing certificate program with 19 or more credits. Transfer of Coursework to Certificate Programs All SCPS credit-bearing certificate programs consist of required courses that must be taken through SCPS.\\xa0If a credit-bearing certificate program has electives, no more than one course, may be approved for academic credits transferred from a regionally accredited college or university external to UVA OR credits taken at UVA prior to admission.\\xa0Exceptions:\\xa0 ACCT 3010 and ACCT 3020 are required courses for the Post Baccalaureate Accounting Certificate Program and may be transferred pending Program Director and SCPS Registrar approval. Program Directors will review the content of the academic credits requested to be transferred and applied to the UVA SCPS certificate program.\\xa0At a minimum, official transcript and course syllabus will be required for content review.\\xa0Program Directors may request relevant material to support the rigor, relevancy and learning outcomes expected of the academic credits to be transferred. Generally, only courses taken within the previous five years prior to the date of acceptance of admission to the certificate program will be considered for transfer. SCPS courses taken as part of completing a certificate program cannot be double-counted toward another SCPS certificate program . In cases where electives may overlap across programs, students are expected to choose distinct electives to satisfy subsequent certificates. Please consult the Departments/Programs section of this Record for more information about certificate programs or the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website: www.scps.virginia.edu Community Scholar Community Scholar Program The Community Scholar Program is a non-degree program offered by the University of Virginia’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Through this program, individuals can enroll as visiting students in select on-Grounds credit classes of the University during the fall and spring semesters. Students who have been suspended or expelled from a prior college for any disciplinary or honor code infractions are not eligible to enroll at UVA as a Community Scholar. Classes are open to Community Scholars on a space available basis and by permission of instructor along with approval of the SCPS Registrar. Full-time degree-seeking students have priority for seats in on-Grounds class offerings. Community Scholars may take no more than two classes per semester, along with any dependent laboratory or discussion sessions, for a maximum of 11.5 credits. Some schools place a lifetime limit on the total number of classes that may be taken as a Community Scholar. Program participants have the opportunity to study with renowned faculty of the University of Virginia, enjoy the same intellectual challenges as students enrolled in degree programs, and earn college credit for their work. Community Scholars bring a broad range of experiences and backgrounds to the classroom and their reasons for participating are similarly varied. Enrolling in classes through the Community Scholar Program allows participants to meet personal and professional needs. For more information please refer to the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website: www.scps.virginia.edu The program serves many purposes for the adult learner. Community Scholars pursue objectives to advance their careers by studying recent developments in their fields. Others seek to satisfy prerequisites for advanced study in medicine, engineering, or education, or explore a graduate department’s course offerings prior to applying to the formal degree program. Academically advanced high school juniors and seniors may be granted permission to register in one undergraduate class per term, after meeting all eligibility requirements.\\xa0First-time High School Community Scholar students, and a parent, must complete an interview and/or attend an orientation session. The Community Scholar Program does not grant degrees. Two part-time undergraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) and the Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management (BPHM) as well as a part-time Master’s of Public Safety (MPS)\\xa0are offered by the University of Virginia’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Those who wish to earn a degree full-time at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville must apply to the Undergraduate Office of Admissions or the appropriate graduate school of the University. Course Selection and Registration Community Scholars may choose courses from departments and schools throughout the University with the exception of the schools of Education and Human Development, Law, Engineering & Applied Science, Medicine, Data Science, and the Darden School of Business. Faculty members reserve the right not to admit a Community Scholar to a class based on class size or lack of prerequisite education. Community Scholars must obtain written permission of the instructor to enroll in each class. For students interested in enrolling in graduate level courses, proof of an undergraduate degree will be required at the time of registration. There may be additional school and/or departmental level requirements to enroll in courses in the Community Scholar program; interested students should consult the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website for details. Students wishing to enroll must first have a term-active UVA student record. All required registration materials must be submitted to the School of Continuing and Professional Studies Registration Office via an online registration form prior to the start date of classes to ensure that required prerequisite actions have been completed. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in the Community Scholar Program must receive a grade of C- or better in each course in which they are enrolled to remain in Good Academic Standing.\\xa0Any student receiving a grade below C- in any course will be placed on Academic Warning for a period of one year.\\xa0During this time, a student may continue to enroll in courses in the Community Scholar Program according to Community Scholar enrollment policies.\\xa0Should the student receive a grade below C-\\xa0in\\xa0a class while on Academic Warning, the student will be placed on Academic Suspension for a period of one year.\\xa0While on Academic Suspension, a student may not enroll in courses through the Community Scholar Program.\\xa0Any student previously placed on Academic Suspension may apply to re-enroll in courses through the Community Scholar program at the end of the term of suspension by contacting the Director of the Community Scholar Program or SCPS Registrar.\\xa0Any student previously placed on Academic Suspension who is allowed to re-enroll who then receives a grade of C- or below in any subsequent class will not be allowed to enroll as a Community Scholar in any future term. Probation or Suspension terms apply to enrollment in any SCPS program\\xa0or course. Course Withdrawals Students enrolled in the Community Scholar program are expected to successfully complete classes in which they are enrolled.\\xa0Any student who withdraws (W appears on academic record, distinct from dropping a class) from four or more classes in a two year period will be placed on Academic Probation for one year.\\xa0During this time, a student may continue to enroll in classes in the Community Scholar Program.\\xa0Should the student withdraw from a class while on Academic Probation, the student will be placed on Academic Suspension for a period of one year.\\xa0 While on Academic Suspension, a student may not enroll in courses through the Community Scholar Program.\\xa0 Any student previously placed on Academic Suspension may apply to re-enroll in courses through the Community Scholar program at the end of the term of suspension by contacting the Director of the Community Scholar Program or SCPS Registrar.\\xa0Any student previously placed on Academic Suspension who is allowed to re-enroll who then withdraws from more than one class will not be allowed to enroll as a Community Scholar in any future term.\\xa0 Probation or Suspension terms apply to enrollment in any SCPS program\\xa0or course. Community Scholars who drop or withdraw from a class after it has begun are subject to a financial penalty and will be charged a percentage of the tuition and fees based on the school week within which the withdrawal occurs. Contact the SCPS Registration Office (scpsregistration@virginia.edu) for full details regarding the current refund schedule. Any refunds owed to the student as a result of withdrawal are first offset against any other amounts owed to the University. Community Scholar drop or withdrawal requests must be made via the online SCPS Drop/Refund Request Form . Responsibilities and Status Community Scholars enrolling in University courses agree to abide by the University Honor System, the University’s rules and regulations, and the School of Continuing and Professional Studies’ policies and applicable procedures. Students who fail to complete required online training modules by stated deadlines will have a registration hold placed on their student accounts; course registration for future terms will be blocked until the training is completed and the hold is removed. In addition, Community Scholars assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner that is civil and compatible with the University’s function as an educational institution. In a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, interference with the orderly process of the University, or interference with the rights of others will not be tolerated. In order to fulfill its functions for imparting and gaining knowledge, the University has the authority and responsibility to maintain order within the University. The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies has the authority to exclude those who are disruptive of the educational process, including those whose behavior would present a threat to the health and safety of others. Because Community Scholars do not pay the required comprehensive fees (which include such items as athletic tickets, intramural access, Student Health, University Transit, and Student Legal Services) expected of full time students,\\xa0they are not eligible to use the services of the Department of Student Health or purchase the University-endorsed Student Health Insurance plan, nor will they receive the above-mentioned services while taking classes through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Community Scholars are urged to make other healthcare arrangements. Comprehensive Community Scholar Program information can be found at www.scps.virginia.edu Course Rules Accuracy of Student Records Students are responsible for\\xa0confirming\\xa0the accuracy of their transcripts. A student must identify and seek correction of any errors by the conclusion of the term following the award of the grade in question or prior to degree conferral if they are graduating that term. Errors not noted within these time limits will not be revised. The Office of the University Registrar provides access to SIS (Student Information System) via the Internet ( www.virginia.edu/registrar ). Students may access their grades and their unofficial transcripts by connecting to SIS. Add/Drop The dates by which students may add or drop a course are established each academic year by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Students should consult the Student\\xa0Resources portal on the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website for information: www.scps.virginia.edu Conduct Students who enroll in degrees, courses, seminars, certificate programs and other lifelong learning activities delivered by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, whether at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville or elsewhere, agree to conduct themselves in a manner that honors the learning process and the University’s function as an educational institution. Students must agree to abide by The Honor Code and all University Regulations (as detailed in the University Regulations section of this Record ). In a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, interference with the orderly process of the University and/or with the rights of the other members of the University community will not be tolerated. The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies has the authority to exclude those who are disruptive of the educational process, including those whose behavior would present a threat to the health and safety of others. Continuing Education Unit A limited number of noncredit activities are designated as Continuing Education Unit (CEU) programs. One CEU is defined as 10 contact hours of participation in an organized educational experience under responsible sponsorship, capable direction, and qualified instruction. SCPS provides information to the Office of the University Registrar (UREG) who permanently records successful participation in programs that have been authorized to award CEU’s. A CEU certificate typically is awarded at the conclusion of the program. Course\\xa0Attendance Regulations Students are expected to attend all class sessions. Instructors establish attendance and participation requirements for each of their classes. Course requirements, regardless of delivery mode, are not waived due to a student’s absence from class. Instructors will require students to make up any missed coursework and may deny credit to any student whose absences are excessive. Poor attendance may result in the student receiving a failing grade. Instructors must keep an attendance record for each student enrolled, for both online and in-person classes, to document attendance and participation. Students may not attend classes in which they are not enrolled, nor may they bring guests to classes in which they are enrolled, without the permission of the instructor. Course Syllabus Faculty members with teaching responsibilities must publish a syllabus for each course they teach and disseminate it to students no later than the first day of classes in each term; faculty members are expected to abide by their published syllabus.\\xa0Changes to the syllabus after the start of the academic term must be communicated to students in writing (usually via e-mail or distribution of a revised syllabus). Email as Official Means of University Communications with Students Email is the official means for communication with every University student regardless of year or enrollment status. The University will send official communications to enrolled students by email using their primary email addresses. Students are expected to open and read those communications in a timely fashion. Official Communication is defined as communications that include content related to a student’s enrollment, financial responsibilities, and compliance with University policies and procedures, including the policies and procedures of the University’s Honor and Judiciary committees. Assignment of a Student’s Primary Email Address: Information Technology Services (ITS) assigns each enrolled student a primary email address. The primary email address is the address to which the University sends official email notifications. These addresses are created for students within a few days of the University receiving their admission information. They are formatted as UVA computing ID @virginia.edu (e.g., mst3k@virginia.edu). Redirecting of Email: Students may use the UVA Email Address Management System to specify the email service to which messages sent to their primary email address will be delivered. In making these delivery choices, students are responsible for selecting the email service(s) they most frequently use to ensure they receive and read official University communications in a timely manner. Expectations Regarding Student Use of Email: Students are expected to check their official email addresses on a frequent and consistent basis to remain informed of University communications, as certain communications may be time sensitive. Students who fail to check their email on a regular basis are responsible for any resulting consequences. Educational Uses of Email: Faculty will determine how email or other means of electronic communication will be used in their classes. Faculty will expect students to read messages sent to their primary email addresses in a timely manner. Appropriate Use of Email: Email must not be used to communicate highly sensitive data as defined in the University’s Data Protection of University Information Policy, found at IRM-003: Data Protection of University Information . Emails must comply with relevant federal and state laws, as well as University policies, including those governing public computing resources, security considerations, and ethics in computing. See the Related Information section for key law and policy references. Email shall not be the sole method for notification where another method of communication is required by law. For additional information and to read the full\\xa0policy, please see IRM-016: Use of Email for Official Communication with Students . Honor System The Honor System has been a defining dimension of life at the University for more than 180 years. Under the Honor System, University students have pledged to act honorably; that is, not to lie, cheat, or steal. This ideal of Honor is not imposed upon students; rather, by choosing to enroll at the University of Virginia, students commit themselves to a community with this common ideal. Specifically, each student at the University signs a pledge to abide by the Honor System as part of his or her application for admission. Students also commit themselves to governing the system; the Honor Committee (together with its support officers and jurors) is composed entirely of students. The central purpose of the Honor System is to sustain and protect a Community of Trust in which students commit themselves to the pursuit of truth and enjoy the freedom to develop their intellectual and personal potential. Dishonest conduct, whether lying, cheating, or stealing, is incompatible with these pursuits, which can thrive only in an atmosphere of trust. The Honor System does not exist merely to punish students who commit Honor offenses; rather, its purpose is to promote and maintain a community where students can rely on each other to act honestly. One benefit of the Honor System is a presumption of honor, i.e., each University student is presumed to act honorably unless his or her actions prove otherwise. This presumption accompanies a student in all of his or her dealings with fellow students, faculty members, administrators, and members of the local community. This positive conception of honor is the heart of the Honor System. Individual responsibility is essential to maintaining the Community of Trust. The Honor System depends entirely upon the willingness of each student to live up to the standards set by the community of his or her fellow students. Any violation of the Honor Code by a University student constitutes a breach of the Community of Trust. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each student to report conduct that may demonstrate a disregard for these basic principles of honor. While the Honor System applies to students enrolled on- and off-Grounds through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, some procedures for administration of the system to continuing and professional studies students differ from those governing on-Grounds full time students. Visit The Honor Committee website: www.virginia.edu/honor for more information. Refunds Programs offered by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies have varying policies regarding refunds. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of the policy associated with the program or courses in which they are enrolled. Please refer to the school’s website for detailed information: https://www.scps.virginia.edu/tuition-financial-aid Student Rights and Responsibilities The University of Virginia is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of the individual are sustained. The University is committed to supporting the exercise of any right guaranteed to individuals by the Constitution and the Code of Virginia and to educating students relative to their responsibilities. Please see University policy regarding rights and responsibilities of students at: https://studentaffairs.virginia.edu/policies/rights Students who fail to complete required online training modules by stated deadlines will have a registration hold placed on their student accounts; course registration for future terms will be blocked until the training is completed and the hold is removed. Suspended Students Individuals who have been suspended from the University of Virginia or from any other college or university are not eligible to enroll through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies as long as the suspension remains in force. Transcripts Transcripts of courses taken along with grades and credits, and degrees received at the University of Virginia are maintained by UREG (Office of the University Registrar) in accordance with the guidelines of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.\\xa0 As the transcript is a record of all academic work attempted at the University, it is not possible to segregate individual courses or semesters or to print only undergraduate or graduate work.\\xa0Current students may view their records in UREG\\xa0upon proof of identification.\\xa0Students may obtain copies of transcripts from UREG by making a written or on-line request authorizing the release of the transcript. The University of Virginia reserves the right to withhold the transcripts of students who have unfulfilled financial or administrative obligations with the University. Access to student records is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\\xa0Any student attempting to gain access to or possession of, another student’s record will be subject to disciplinary proceedings and suspension from the University.

Curricular Requirements Curricular Requirements Please see the B.I.S. and BPHM degree program sections in this Record . For certificate program curricular requirements please see specific program information under SCPS: Departments/Programs in this Record . Degree Information Bachelor of\\xa0Interdisciplinary Studies The Bachelor of\\xa0Interdisciplinary Studies\\xa0(B.I.S.) degree program is tailored to adults who wish to pursue an undergraduate degree through part-time\\xa0study. Approved in 1999 by the Board of Visitors and the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the B.I.S. program makes it possible for students with earned college credits to complete undergraduate degrees. The B.I.S. program offers a challenging and intellectually stimulating curriculum with evening, weekend and online courses drawn from those already offered at the University or approved by University faculty specifically for this degree program. The program maintains a full course schedule in the summer as well as during the fall and spring semesters; some classes are available in person or in a blended format, but most are fully online. Please consult the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies section of this Record or the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website for additional information: www.scps.virginia.edu Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management The Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management (BPHM) approved by the Board of Visitors and the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia in 2014, prepares students with technical backgrounds in emergency medical services, health information management, medical laboratory technology, occupational therapy assistant, physical therapy assistant, radiography, respiratory therapy, and sonography to assume managerial and leadership roles in the healthcare system. This program gives nationally certified health professionals with the appropriate associate’s degree\\xa0the opportunity to earn a bachelor’s degree from UVA on a part-time basis. All courses needed to complete the general education, major core, and elective requirements of the part-time degree are offered online, either in a synchronous or asynchronous format. Please consult the Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management section of this Record or the School of Continuing and Professional Studies website for additional information: www.scps.virginia.edu Grades Courses carrying a School of Continuing and Professional Studies subject area (mnemonic) use the following grading system: A+, A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F. S (satisfactory) and U (unsatisfactory) are used for some class offerings. For noncredit courses, the grade notation is N (no credit) which indicates successful completion of the class offering. Students who audit classes receive the designation AU (audit). The symbol W is used when a student officially drops a course before its completion or if the student withdraws from an academic program of the University. When the School of Continuing and Professional Studies offers courses in collaboration with other schools of the University, these courses follow the grading system of their associated schools, as outlined in each school’s section of this Record . Audit Students who wish to audit a class (enroll in credit classes without earning academic credit) may do so on a space available basis, with the permission of the instructor. Credit or audit status must be indicated at the time of registration. No change in status can be made following the drop deadline. Admission requirements are the same for auditing students as for students enrolled for credit. An AU (audit) cannot be changed to a letter grade. Auditing students are to meet the same requirements and standards of the course as those students enrolled for credit. A grade of W is recorded for any student who discontinues the audit after the drop deadline or who fails to meet the instructor’s standards. Audited classes are not applicable to degrees or certificates. Students who audit classes are responsible for full payment of all relevant tuition and fees. Credit/No Credit Students enrolled in undergraduate degree programs of the University of Virginia should consult with the appropriate\\xa0department before selecting the credit/no credit (CR/NC) grading option. Students enrolled in certain courses for professional development may select the CR/NC option if available. Courses taken with this grading option may not be transferred into a degree program. The use of CR/NC in certificate programs is governed by the academic policies of the individual program. Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the class.\\xa0Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student consults with the program’s senior program director.\\xa0If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to the Associate Dean for Academic Programs. The associate dean’s decision is final.\\xa0 At each stage of their appeal, students should provide any supporting documentation they believe is important to their appeal.\\xa0Appeals must be initiated within one month of the final date by which grades are posted for the term in question. Grade Changes No grade for a class may be changed after it has been submitted to the Office of the University Registrar (UREG) without the class instructor certifying in writing that, because of an error in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade was submitted. Grade Lapse Procedure An incomplete that is not removed by the assigned date will be converted to a grade of F (failure). Only the appropriate instructor may authorize removal of an Incomplete designation. Degree-seeking students who receive an IN (incomplete) or an F (failure) in any class cannot enroll in another class unless the program director or SCPS Registrar grants permission. Incomplete A grade of incomplete (IN) should be a rare occurrence. If late in the term, circumstances arise beyond a student’s control and all other coursework is complete, the student and instructional faculty may negotiate an extension for submission of final coursework. Prior to the final class, the student must request an IN from the instructional faculty in writing; the instructional faculty must initiate the SCPS Request for a Grade of Incomplete Form and submit the signed form to the SCPS Registrar. The student must complete all class requirements and submit the completed work to the instructional faculty by the faculty’s imposed deadline, at which time the faculty replaces the IN with a letter grade. Typical extensions are for no more than 30 to 60 days beyond the final class meeting. If the work is not completed by the designated agreed upon deadline and a letter grade is not entered, the IN automatically defaults to an ‘F’. Only in extreme cases will this deadline be extended; extensions require approval of the SCPS Registrar. A degree or certificate will not be awarded while an Incomplete grade remains on the transcript. A student may not request an Incomplete in an attempt to raise his or her grade. An incomplete that is not removed by the assigned date will be converted to a grade of F (failure). Only the appropriate instructor may authorize removal of an Incomplete designation. Degree-seeking students who receive an IN (incomplete) or an F (failure) in any class cannot enroll in another class unless the program director or SCPS Registrar grants permission. Effective for Fall 2022 University-wide disruption.\\xa0Student had option to select CR/GC/NC grading rubric. Credit (CR) – CR awarded for a grade of middle C or higher and meets all degree requirements.\\xa0CR does not affect GPA. General Credit (GC) – GC awarded for passing grades below C (including C-, D+, D, or D-) and meets any degree requirement that can be satisfied by a passing grade below C.\\xa0GC does not affect GPA. No Credit (NC) – NC awarded for a non-passing grade (that is, F).\\xa0NC does not earn credit or meet any requirements and does not affect GPA. Intra-University Transfers Transfer of School of Continuing and Professional Studies Course Credits to Other Academic Programs Students wishing to transfer credit from the School of Continuing and Professional Studies to another program at the University should consult that program as to the transferability of the courses and their credit prior to registering with the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. Leaving and Returning to the University Enforced Withdrawal The Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies may compel a student to withdraw from\\xa0an SCPS\\xa0program for good cause. A student who is asked to withdraw from\\xa0a program may petition the Dean for readmission after one calendar year. Leave of Absence Degree seeking students who wish to take a one-semester leave of absence must submit a Leave of Absence request and receive approval from the academic advisor, program director, and SCPS Registrar. The Leave of Absence must be filed before the semester start date. Degree-seeking students\\xa0who wish to take a leave of absence for a second consecutive semester should follow the process as outlined; the request must be approved by the academic advisor,\\xa0program director, and SCPS Registrar. Students on approved leaves of absence are not required to apply for readmission prior to their return, but should notify their academic advisor and program director of their intended return at least 30 days before the published date of final registration for that semester. Medical Withdrawal A student may withdraw from\\xa0a SCPS\\xa0program for reasons of health with the approval of the SCPS Registrar and appropriate program director of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. A notation of Medical Withdrawal will appear on the student’s transcript. Readmission Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University. Application must be made to the Admissions Office in the School of Continuing & Professional Studies at least 60 days prior to the start of classes during the semester a student wishes to matriculate. In addition to the approvals required by University policy, applications for readmission must be approved by the appropriate program director and the\\xa0SCPS Registrar. Reenrollment Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their reenrollment at the University. Students who have been on an approved leave of absence may\\xa0request reenrollment\\xa0to return to the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, as long as their return is within the agreed-upon time frame arranged through the school’s Admissions Office. Voluntary Withdrawal A term which refers to the student’s decision to end his/her programmatic relationship with an SCPS program and, therefore, the University. Normally, withdrawal is associated with permanent discontinuation.Discontinued participation in a class does not constitute a withdrawal from the class or the program.

Achieve at least a 1.800 GPA. Have no more than one grade below C-. To enroll in a fifth semester, students are required to have passed at least 54 credits; to\\xa0enroll in a seventh semester students must pass at least 84 credits.\\xa0 If a student is below these credit thresholds of the fifth and seventh semester, they are no longer in good standing. Students who fall behind in the number of credits required must make up their work in the University’s summer session. Part-time students are in good standing if they achieve at least a 1.800 grade point average for the semester. Academic Warning A student\\xa0is placed on academic warning if they fail to maintain good standing\\xa0in any fall or spring term (see the “Good Standing” section of the Record). A notation of Academic Warning is placed on the student’s advising transcript.\\xa0 A student with a status of Academic Warning\\xa0is expected to meet with their advisor no later than the add period of the next semester. A student on warning shall retain such status for the following fall or spring semester. Enrollment in summer session courses does not impact\\xa0academic warning status. Students on academic warning who withdraw or take a leave of absence should submit a Return to the University eform.\\xa0 Procedures for Returning to the University are described under Leaving and Returning to the University.\\xa0 If approved to return, they will continue to be on Academic Warning and must attain Good Standing or face Academic Suspension by virtue of two consecutive semesters of incurring Academic Warning. Academic Suspension Students\\xa0are subject to suspension after incurring academic warning in two consecutive semesters (fall or spring). Students under suspension forfeit commitments of financial aid.\\xa0 Students under suspension may not transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree. Two full (fall or spring) terms must elapse before they are eligible to apply to return to School of Data Science.\\xa0 Procedures for Returning to the University from suspension are described under Leaving and Returning to the University. Readmission is not guaranteed, and students are encouraged to meet with their Student Success Advisor to determine appropriate goals to be achieved while suspended.\\xa0 Application for readmission is considered upon presentation of evidence that the difficulties that led to suspension have been overcome.\\xa0 A second suspension is final; a student who is suspended a second time will not be readmitted. Class Standing Students\\xa0are categorized by class according to the number of credits they have earned at the University of Virginia as follows: first year: 0-29 credits; second year: 30-59 credits; third year: 60-89 credits; fourth year: 90 or more credits. AP and transfer credits are not included in the computation of class standing; credits not completed, taken via transfer credit, or completed unsuccessfully are not included. Admission Requirements Data Science, B.S. All prospective undergraduate students apply through the School of Data Science Office of Admission. Prerequisites Completion of 24 credit hours at the University of Virginia by the end of the Spring of a student’s first year, including DS 1001 and the Programming Requirement. DS 1001 Foundations of Data Science must be taken at the University of Virginia and completed with a grade of C- or higher. The programming requirement may be met in one of the following ways: Enrollment in\\xa0DS 1002 Programming for Data Science Enrollment in one of the following courses at UVA CS 1110/1111/1112: Introduction to Programming PHYS 1655/ CS 1113: Introduction to Python for Scientists and Engineers Test credit AP Computer Science A with a score of 4 or 5 IB HL Computer Science with a score of 5, 6, or 7 Passing the CS 1110 Place-Out Test Students who pass the test receive a notation in SIS.\\xa0 The School of Data Science encourages students to complete the place-out test in Python.\\xa0 Students must be proficient in Python prior to the start of classes. Students in any school of enrollment at the University of Virginia may apply in the Spring term of their first year according to admissions deadlines posted on the website. Due to the curriculum sequencing and the limited number of seats in the B.S. in Data Science, only students at the University of Virginia who have just completed their first year may apply. Students who have not completed both prerequisites by the end of the Spring of their first year may not apply. Students in their second, third, or fourth year at the University of Virginia may not apply. Students transferring from colleges or universities outside of the University of Virginia may not apply. Undergraduate students who do not enroll in the B.S. in Data Science may declare the Minor in Data Science or consider the M.S. in Data Science (online and residential formats) or the Ph.D. in Data Science upon graduation. Deferring Admission A student admitted into the Bachelor of Science in Data Science\\xa0may petition to postpone enrollment in the School of Data Science due to extenuating circumstances. Requests to defer an offer of admission will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed. Rescinding an Offer of Admission It is the School of Data Science’s expectation that all applicants uphold the intellectual, ethical, and professional standards of the School and the University of Virginia. By applying to the School of Data Science, students agree to abide by the principles of the UVA Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct. The School may rescind an offer of admission up until the date of matriculation for, but not limited to, the following reasons: An admitted applicant fails to show satisfactory academic progress in any courses completed after receiving their offer of admission; An applicant is found to have presented misleading or fraudulent information during the application process; An applicant fails to follow the principles of the Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct described above. Minor in Data Science Current undergraduate UVA students from any school of enrollment who have declared their major in SIS may declare the minor in Data Science by submitting the minor declaration form. Students pursuing the B.S. in Data Science may not declare a minor in Data Science. Attendance In addition to the attendance policy in the university regulations, students are expected to attend all classes throughout the academic session as defined by the University Registrar’s academic calendar, which gives dates from start and end of session, exam week, and breaks and holidays. Grounds for excusable absences are to be arranged between the student and the instructor of the course in question; policies are typically provided by the instructor in the course syllabus.\\xa0Failure by students to attend lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses for which they are registered may subject them to penalties. Absence from written examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination attested by a physician’s certificate or for other cause that the instructor, by special action, may approve. An unexcused absence in such cases constitutes failure of the examination. Course Rules Course Enrollment and Discontinuation Students may change their class schedules via SIS. Students are responsible for being aware of the dates each semester for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from a course, or for changing the grading basis of a course.\\xa0 Students may not enroll in classes after the add deadline for the semester. If admission to a course requires the instructor’s permission, students should add their name to the instructor’s permission list in SIS and wait for an invitation to join the class. Note that being on a permission list does not guarantee that a student will be offered a space in a class. Students who decide to discontinue a course in which they have enrolled must use SIS to drop the course within the deadlines.\\xa0Students who fail to revise their list of current courses by using SIS within the drop deadline must withdraw from the course. After the drop period, students may withdraw from a course in SIS with a grade of W until eight weeks from the first day of the semester.\\xa0After this point, students must either complete the course or, with the instructor’s endorsement, submit a request for an incomplete. Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure receive a failing grade. Due to course sequencing and availability, students may not withdraw from core DS courses. A student who does not maintain enrollment during each Fall and Spring semester and does not have an approved leave of absence must apply for readmission via the Returning to the University eform, due March 1 for the fall semester and October 1 for the spring semester.\\xa0Readmission is not guaranteed. Course Load Full time students enroll with the expectation of completing their degrees in no more than six semesters upon enrollment in the School of Data Science (eight total at the University of Virginia).\\xa0 A full-time undergraduate course load is 12 credits.\\xa0 An average of 15 graded credits per semester is recommended for a student to graduate within eight semesters of study.\\xa0 Students may petition via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu to register for fewer than 12 credits or more than 17 credits each semester.\\xa0 A student who completes fewer than 12 credits incurs academic warning (see Academic Standing Section).\\xa0 Students in their final semester prior to graduation whose petition for a reduced course load has been approved do not incur academic probation. In serious medical or extenuating personal circumstances and upon petition via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu,\\xa0a student may be permitted to enroll as a full-time or part-time student in a seventh and eighth semester in the School of Data Science (nineth and tenth semester at UVA). Part-time students are limited to a maximum of six credits per semester.\\xa0 Students registered full time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their enrollment to part-time status. A reduced load is\\xa0defined as greater than 6 credits and less than 12 credits, while part-time is defined as 6 credits or less and no more than 2 classes. Reduced-load enrollment still bears full-time tuition and fees, while part-time enrollment is paid by the credit hour. Enrolling at either reduced load or part-time requires petition via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu. Students seeking reduced-load or part-time enrollment should first speak with theirstudent success to ensure timely graduation and with Student Financial Services to understand impacts to their financial aid packages. Course Sequencing The B.S. in Data Science curriculum is designed intentionally, and courses will not be offered out of sequence. Students who wish to finish their undergraduate studies in fewer than four years should consider pursuing another major and the Minor in Data Science. Exclusion from Classes A\\xa0student who is making no real progress in a class, or whose behavior is detracting from the class, may be excluded from that course by the Program Director with a grade of W or F. Students have five calendar days following written notification of this exclusion in which to appeal by petition via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu. Until the final disposition of the appeal, the student is considered enrolled in the class. Graduate-Level Courses Undergraduate students may not enroll in courses numbered 6000 and higher.\\xa0 Undergraduate students may enroll in 5000-level courses offered in-person pending\\xa0availability. Courses Taken Outside of the School of Data Science Students\\xa0who wish to enroll in courses outside of the School of Data Science must follow that School’s deadlines for enrollment, dropping, adding, and withdrawing from a class. Data Science, B.S. ENROLLMENT Students are required to register for a full course load as determined by the program requirements by the stated deadline each term unless further approval has been obtained. These credit hours should come from the graded core and elective courses for the program during that term.\\xa0Students must register for courses on the standard lettered scale (A through F). Audited courses and Credit/No Credit do not count toward the full course enrollment requirement. Students are limited to the credit hours as determined by the program requirements unless they have permission to enroll part-time or enroll over the course limits. The registration process is not complete until a student has paid tuition and fees or made satisfactory arrangements with Student Financial Services. Residency Requirement A recipient of the B.S. in Data Science must have been in residence for three academic years in this University, and registered in the School of Data Science during the semester in which they receive a degree.\\xa0 Sixty credits must be taken in residence at the University of Virginia. Time to Degree All work for the Bachelor of Science must be completed within eight semesters of matriculation and with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. Upon approval of a petition via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu, a student may be permitted to enroll\\xa0in a ninth\\xa0semester to complete a second major or a minor. Degree Conferral A student who wishes to receive their degree must apply for graduation via the Student Information System. Deadlines for degree applications are determined by the University Registrar. The Bachelor of Science in Data Science degree is conferred by the general faculty upon candidates recommended by the School of Data Science faculty as having completed a prescribed course of study of no less than 120 credits with a cumulative grade point average of 2.000. Graduation Students may not continue to enroll in classes after their degree is conferred unless they have been accepted to another degree program at the University. Students whose official graduation date is\\xa0December will be invited to participate in Final Exercises the following May. Minor in Data Science Completion The completion of the Data Science minor requires a minimum of 15 graded credits. Minimum of 3 courses/9 credits must be data science courses (DS XXXX) 3 credit Programming course 3 credit Analytics course 3 credit Systems course 3 credit Data Design & Value course DS 4002 or a domain elective Data science courses count toward the graduation hours in any school of enrollment. Students should consult with their School of Enrollment advisors and Registrar for policies on double-counting credits. Credit/No Credit Grades No course taken with a grading option of credit (CR)/no credit (NC) satisfies a major, minor, or general education requirement. Students may request permission from their instructor to take a course for credit (CR)/no credit (NC) in place of the regular grades A through F for a given course. The instructor has the right to deny permission to take the course on a CR/NC basis. If this occurs, students may either change back to the regular grading option or they may drop the course entirely if it is within the University’s add/drop or withdraw period.\\xa0 A student can indicate the grading option in SIS upon registering for the course and no later than the add deadline. It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor the minimum academic level of achievement for the grade of CR. Grades The academic performance of a student in each course taken for a grade is recorded as one of the following grades: A+, A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F. All courses intended to fulfill program requirements must be taken for a letter grade. Effective for Fall 2022 University-wide disruption. Student had option to select CR/GC/NC grading rubric. Credit (CR) – CR awarded for a grade of middle C or higher and meets all degree requirements. CR does not affect GPA. General Credit (GC) – GC awarded for passing grades below C (including C-, D+, D, or D-) and meets any degree requirement that can be satisfied by a passing grade below C. GC does not affect GPA. No Credit (NC) – NC awarded for a non-passing grade (that is, F). NC does not earn credit or meet any requirements and does not affect GPA. Audit Due to the small size of classes, data science courses may not be taken on an audit basis. Grade Changes Errors in calculation or transcription are the only acceptable reasons for a grade change. Grades cannot be changed after a degree is conferred, or more than one semester following the end of the course, whichever comes first. Instructors must submit a grade change eform in SIS. Incomplete and Missing Grades Refer to the University Record for the policy on incompletes.\\xa0 The School of Data Science uses the following procedures for requesting and approving an incomplete: An incomplete grade (IN) is a temporary grade that may be given at the instructor’s discretion to a student who needs additional time to complete a class due to extenuating circumstances. An IN does not affect the GPA and is replaced by the final grade, which is submitted by the instructor after the student completes the work no more than thirty days following the end of the course. If the final grade is not submitted by this deadline, the grade of IN converts to an F. Instructors are not authorized to extend the time for completion of course work without the Associate Dean’s approval. If an IN is warranted, the student should submit a Request For An Incomplete Grade (Undergraduate Student) eform. If the course instructor approves, the instructor establishes the required deliverables with due dates and forwards these terms to the student for a signature showing acknowledgement of the terms. An IN is an appropriate option for a student if they: have completed approximately 75% or more of the work for the class. are not failing the class. have consulted with the instructor and have a viable plan to complete the coursework within the allotted time frame. only plan to request an incomplete for one course (for students enrolled part-time), or two courses (for students enrolled full-time load). Students requesting more than these based upon their enrollment are required to meet with their\\xa0Student Success Advisor. do not currently have an incomplete grade from a prior semester. Transfer Credit If a course taken elsewhere and transferred to the University prior to matriculation in the School of Data Science is repeated and passed at the University, the repeated course appears on the student’s transcript, the grade earned is included in the grade point average, and the credits earned will count toward the 120 required for graduation.\\xa0 The course taken from the original institution will still appear on the transcript but is excluded from the total number of cumulative degree credits. Credit awarded as “X000T” credit will not count towards fulfillment of any general education requirements. Students under suspension may not apply transfer credits from other institutions toward their degree. Prior to enrolling in a course from another institution, students may request permission via email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu to receive transfer credit for elective coursework. If a grade of C or better is earned along with prior approval received as outlined above, the credits will be added as transfer credit. Test Credit For more information on credit received based upon specific scores on various tests, consult the table found in the section on Admission in the general University section of this Record. Final Examinations Students are not permitted to take a final examination before its regularly scheduled time. When genuinely serious conditions exist, students may petition via email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu to be\\xa0allowed to postpone a final examination until later in the exam period or after the regular exam period. Students with exams in three consecutive periods may take one of them at an alternative time by petition via email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu thirty days before the last day of classes for the term.\\xa0An unexcused absence from a final examination results in an automatic F in the course. Intra-University Transfers A student who completes one or more semesters in the School of Data Science and wishes to return to their initial school of enrollment must apply as an Intra-University transfer student and follow that school’s policies and deadlines prior to the start of the semester. Leaving and Returning to the University Further Information on Withdrawal For further information about voluntary withdrawal, medical withdrawal, and enforced withdrawal, see the University Regulations section of this Record. Due to the lock-step curriculum, required courses may not be offered every semester, resulting in delayed graduation if a student withdraws or is on leave for a term.\\xa0\\xa0Direct questions about financial aid impacts as well as tuition and fees for withdrawn students to Student Financial Services. Leave of Absence Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their absence from the university.\\xa0 The University withdrawal form is located on the SIS Student Self Service page menu under eform.\\xa0 The form is titled Leaving the University (Leaves, Withdrawals, and Transfers). Leave of Absence is an action students can take after the completion of a semester, indicating that the student plans to be away from the university for at least one semester. Withdrawal is an action students can take during the semester. All registered courses will show a W, indicating withdrawal. If a student withdraws within 60 days prior to the starting day of the next semester, the student may not attend the University during that semester. For example, withdrawing during the fall term in December precludes a student from enrolling in J-term and spring semesters, and the student may apply to reenroll (see below) for the summer and/or fall term. Application for reenrollment from a leave of absence or withdrawal must be made using the Returning to the University form on the SIS Student Self Service page menu under eForms. Refer to the Reenrollment section below for additional information. A student who wishes to suspend full-time study temporarily may request approval via an email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu\\xa0to undertake a leave of absence.\\xa0Leaves are approved for a full term or academic year, with a student eligible for up to two years of leave cumulatively. Students taking such leave\\xa0may normally return only in the academic semester that follows the last completed semester (e.g., a student who takes a leave after the fall semester, third year, must enroll in third-year courses in a subsequent spring semester). A student on an approved leave may under certain circumstances purchase health insurance during the first twelve months of the leave\\xa0but is otherwise ineligible for financial aid and the use of University facilities. A student must affirm their intent to return from leave at least 60 calendar days before the end of the leave. Medical Withdrawal Due to significant medical reasons, a student may need to withdraw from the semester.\\xa0 A student may withdraw for medical reasons at any point in the semester.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, students who return after a medical withdrawal must be cleared by Student Health and Wellness (see Readmission below).\\xa0 In very unusual medical circumstances, documented by a health professional, a student who did not withdraw during the semester has one semester in which to petition for a retroactive medical withdrawal.\\xa0 If approved, all grades convert to W’s and the student is obliged to be absent for a full semester before resuming full-time study. Majors and Minors Declaring a Major/Minor Upon matriculation to the BSDS program, a student’s school of enrollment shifts to the School of Data Science. It is only possible to declare a second major with another program in the College of Arts and Sciences or the Youth and Social Innovation program in the School of Education and Human Development.\\xa0 The deadline to add a second major or minor is December of a student’s fourth-year. In pursuing a second major, students do not receive two degrees from the University.\\xa0 They receive a B.S. in Data Science.\\xa0 Concentration, major and/or minor status is reflected on student transcripts. Students are responsible for completing the major or minor form from the appropriate department and for obtaining the signature of the chair or director of that program. Forms must be submitted to the Registrar of the School of Data Science to be accurately reflected in the Student Information System. Students in the Schools of Engineering and Applied Science, Commerce, Nursing, and Batten School cannot declare a second major in the School of Data Science. The School of Data Science will only be listed as a student’s first major. Repeated Courses No courses can be repeated except as specified in the University Regulations on Repeated Courses in the Undergraduate Record .\\xa0DS 4022 Final Project may be repeated twice. Repeated courses, whether under the same course number or not, may\\xa0not\\xa0both be counted for degree credit. Simultaneous Counting of Courses and Cross-listed Courses One course may simultaneously meet two requirements; it may also satisfy general education requirements.\\xa0 Courses taken to fulfill general education requirements may be counted toward a first or second major or toward a minor. Petitions, Appeal and Grievances Petitions may be submitted in writing via SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu for exceptions to the School of Data Science program policy. Grade appeals or grievances must be submitted in writing via SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu before the last day of add/drop for the next term (fall or spring). Students are expected to follow complaint or grievance processes set forth in applicable University policies, including but not limited to those regarding: Preventing and Addressing Discrimination and Harassment Preventing and Addressing Retaliation Standards of Conduct Student Rights and Responsibilities Student Sexual Misconduct For situations not otherwise directly addressed in University policy, students should attempt to resolve concerns or conflicts by working directly with a faculty member or the program director. Conflicts or concerns that cannot be resolved to the student’s satisfaction should be discussed with the Associate Dean of Academic and Faculty Affairs of the School of Data Science. Readmission and Reinstatement Students who wish to return to the University after a suspension, a withdrawal, or an unapproved absence from the University must be formally readmitted. Applications for readmission are not guaranteed. Students should consult\\xa0“Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University.\\xa0 Students may file for readmission through the Student Information System (SIS).\\xa0 The Returning to the University eform is due March 1 for the fall semester and October 1 for the spring semester.\\xa0\\xa0Students will be notified of the decision.\\xa0 For readmission following a medical withdrawal, students should also follow the steps outlined by the Department of Student Health and Wellness https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu// . A student who voluntarily withdraws from the program or otherwise ceases to enroll for a period of up to two academic years and wishes to resume enrollment must petition via email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu for reinstatement at least sixty days in advance of the next registration period. A student who has been absent for longer than two years must petition to return via email to SDSRegistrar@virginia.edu. Study Abroad The School of Data Science encourages its students to pursue education abroad outside of the Fall or Spring terms, as the B.S. in Data Science curriculum sequences courses intentionally each semester. Consult the International Studies Office for opportunities to study abroad in January Term, Spring Break, and Summer.\\xa0 Refer to the Transfer Credit section of this Record for transfer policies.

Admission Requirements Academic Advising Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence Curricular Requirements Course Rules Degree Information Final Examinations Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Public Professional Licensure Disclosure Study Abroad Transfer Credit Admission Requirements All students are subject to the academic policies specified in the University Registrar’s section of the Undergraduate Record titled “University Regulations.” In addition, students must follow the policies of the School of Education and Human Development (EHD). Offers of admission are contingent on achieving good academic standing for the semester prior to joining EHD. If an applicant does not achieve good academic standing in the semester prior to admission to EHD, then the offer of admission may be revoked at the discretion of the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs. Application to the School of Education and Human Development There are multiple ways that students can engage in the School of Education and Human Development. Although any student in the university community is welcome to take courses in EHD, students who wish to obtain a degree should apply to one of the following programs by the end of their second year. Teacher Education Students applying to the Elementary Education, Special Education, or Early Childhood education majors must submit the EHD Undergraduate Application for admission by February 1 of their first or second year. EHD is no longer accepting application to its dual-degree B/MT program. Students interested in teaching a preK-12 or secondary content are (e.g., mathematics, English) should consult the Teacher Education website for guidelines for these graduate-level programs. Speech Communication Disorders Those who wish to apply to the speech communication disorders major must submit the EHD Undergraduate Application for admission by February 1 of their second year. Kinesiology Students interested in the kinesiology major must apply for admission through the University’s Office of Undergraduate Admission ( http://www.admission.virginia.edu/ ). Depending on space in the kinesiology major, students may apply for internal transfer by submitting the EHD Undergraduate Application by February 1 of their first or second years. Youth and Social Innovation Those who wish to apply to the youth and social innovation major must submit the EHD Undergraduate Application for admission by February 1 of their first or second years. Residence Requirement A recipient of a B.S.Ed. degree from the School of Education and Human Development must complete at least 60 of the 120 credits required for graduation at the University of Virginia. Exceptions for emergency situations require approvals from a student’s advisor, program coordinator, and the Senior Associate Dean for\\xa0Academic Programs and Student Affairs. The last year of candidacy must be spent at this University, and all courses offered in the major for the degree must be completed at the University unless written permission is obtained from the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs. Academic Advising Each student is assigned an academic advisor who is a faculty member in the major. The student is required to meet with their advisor at least once per semester to schedule classes and plan their course of study. Students are also encouraged to contact their advisors for other matters related to academics, career planning, professional service, or to discuss any other matters. Academic Standing Good Standing Students are considered to be in good standing at the end of a semester if, in that semester, they have completed at least 12 credits of coursework with at least a 1.8 semester average and have no more than one grade below C-. By the end of the fourth semester, students in a EHD major must have earned at least 54 credits in order to enroll in a fifth semester; passing at least 84 credits is necessary to enroll in a seventh semester. Students who fall below these criteria must make up their work during summer session or, with prior approval, at another institution, as students are allowed only 8 semesters at the University of Virginia (proportionally fewer if they enter as transfer students). A minimum of 120 credits and a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher are required for graduation. Warning, Suspension, and Re-enrollment Warning A student will be placed on academic warning after the Fall or Spring semester in which good standing is not attained. The term “academic warning” appears only on the advising transcript. A student on warning is expected to meet with their advisor and program coordinator no later than the add period of the next semester. If the student does not regain good standing at the end of the next semester, the student will be suspended. Credit hour overloads are not allowed for students on academic warning. Suspension Suspended students may apply for readmission to the School of Education and Human Development or enroll in courses through the University’s Summer Session after one calendar year from the effective date of the suspension. Students who are readmitted after being suspended must achieve academic good standing or face a second academic suspension. A second academic suspension is final. Students may not present credit from other institutions while on academic suspsension. Returning from Suspension Students returning to their studies after suspension should refer to the Returning to the University section of this record. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. Reasons for appeal include errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted, or an incomplete grade. Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student consults with the chair of the department. Students may consult with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs to confirm which department chair should be contacted. If this path proves unsuccessful in the resolution of the matter, the student may appeal to the dean of the School of Education and Human Development. The dean’s decision is final. At each stage of their appeal, students should provide any supporting documentation they believe is important to their appeal. Appeals must be initiated within one month of the final date by which grades are posted for the term in question. Other Academic Grievances Due process is guaranteed to all students. See “ University Regulations: Academic ” in the University Regulations section or consult the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs office, 102 Ridley Hall. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List Full-time Undergraduate students at EHD become eligible for the\\xa0dean’s list at the end of each semester by demonstrating superior academic achievement. To be eligible, EHD students must take a minimum of 15 credits and earn a GPA of 3.7 or higher. Courses taken on a credit/no-credit basis may not be counted toward the minimum credits necessary to be on the\\xa0dean’s list\\xa0with the exception of clinical experience credits required for the teacher education major (EDIS 388X, EDIS 486X, EDIS 488X). Any student receiving an F, NC, or NG is ineligible to be on the\\xa0dean’s list. Distinction and Honors Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.600 or higher receive their degrees “with honors”, with a GPA of 3.750 or higher receive their degrees “with high honors”, and with a GPA of 3.900 or higher receive their degrees “with highest honors”. Curricular and General Education Requirements Curricular Requirements To earn the B.S. Ed., a student must present 120 credits which satisfy EHD’s general education curriculum and major requirements. All requirements for the B.S.Ed. must be taken on a graded basis. A maximum of 24 credits of CR/NC courses,\\xa0and a maxiumum of two KLPA courses may be used toward a degree. If a course for which AP or dual-enrollment credits have been awarded is repeated at the University, the AP credits can be petitioned to the student’s advisor and EHD’s Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs as general elective credits, otherwise the AP credits will be disallowed. The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average. General Education Requirements Competency Requirements B.S.Ed. students should demonstrate competencies in written communication through their general education and major course requirements. Specific writing requirements must be evidenced prior to satisfying all degree requirements. Note to Echols Scholars: The School of Education and Human Development honors the College of Arts and Sciences policy of waiving competency/area requirements for Echols Scholars (this does not apply to Teacher Education students due to licensure regulations). Please be aware, however, that students are still required to satisfy prerequisites for their declared major. Note for students enrolled in the College’s Engagements or Forums Curriculum: If you are a rising second year student who has been participating in the College’s Engagements or Forum experiences, you will not be permitted to enroll in these in your second year if you accept admission into EHD. FORU credits received during your first and/or second year will transfer forward as general electives and will not satisfy any of EHD’s area requirements. EGMT credits may be used to fulfill the Humanities Area Requirement for the Kinesiology, Speech Communication Disorders, and Youth and Social Innovation majors. 1st Writing (skills of writing), 3 credits All students should take a course in the College of Arts and Sciences in English Writing (ENWR). Of note, ENWR course credits cannot be double counted with any other requirements. No AP exam or dual enrollment credits satisfy this requirement. More information on the 1st writing requirement may be found on the College of Arts & Sciences website: http://professionalwriting.as.virginia.edu/requirements. 2nd Writing, 3 credits All students should take a second course that has intensive writing components within a content course. It is permissible to double count the second writing course with general education requirements and major requirements if it meets certain criteria as determined by the EHD Undergraduate Committee. See link to: Second Writing Requirement Form . Cultural Literacy, 3 credits B.S.Ed. students should demonstrate cultural literacy through a course that provides a global perspective, enhances cultural awareness, and/or broadens perspectives. College courses designated as Non-Western Perspective and/or Cultures and Societies of the World also satisfy this requirement. Courses that meet this 3-credit requirement may include (choose one): EDHS 4310 - Exploring Linguistic Diversity EDIS 3017 - Black Education: Theories, PreK-12 Pedagogy and Practice EDIS 3060 - Poverty and the Young Child: Understanding Impacts in the US EDIS 5422 - Cross-Cultural Education for Diverse Learners EDLF 3240 - Education in Multicultural Societies EDLF 3460 - Race and Identity in Youth Development EDLF 3610 - Immigrant Youth and Families EDLF 4610 - Civil Rights Movement and Education EDLF 5700 - Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity in Youth Development A credit-bearing study abroad course may satisfy this requirement Data Literacy/Statistics, 3 credits B.S.Ed. students will demonstrate competency in data literacy and statistics by earning an AP Statistics exam score of 4 (STAT 1120) or 5 (STAT 2120), or by taking a statistics course such as EDLF 2080 - Fundamentals of Health and Social Sciences Statistics . In addition to a statistics course offered at EHD, this requirement can be satisfied through STAT courses offered in the College, or any discipline-focused statistics course (e.g., Psychology, Sociology). Area Requirements Mathematics and Natural sciences, 9 credits Beyond the Data Literacy/Statistics requirement, B.S.Ed. students will complete courses in mathematics and natural sciences from two different departments. Courses may include Mathematics, Statistics, Astronomy, Biology,\\xa0Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, and Physics. Does not include the required 3 Data Literacy/Statistics credits.

Major Requirements A minimum of 30 credits. Unless approved by the program, all students must take the required Major Core courses at UVA. Students must choose the Major Electives from a pre-determined list of courses. See individual programs for more information. Double Major Undergraduate students may be accepted into no more than two majors at the University. Courses taken for the major can double count with General Education requirements (Competencies and Area requirements). Students must receive permission from both departments/programs in order to share courses between a major and a second major. Second Major in the College of Arts and Sciences B.S.Ed. candidates may earn one major in the College of Arts and Sciences. The student must obtain prior admission from the chair or director of the undergraduate program of the College program or department in which the student seeks the major. Courses may not be double counted toward the fulfillment of major requirements unless formally approved by the College of Arts & Sciences for the specific College second major. In pursuing the above, the student will not receive two degrees from the University. The student receives a Bachelor of Science in Education from the School of Education and Human Development. The College major designation appears as degree information on the official transcript. This information does not appear on the diploma. Students are responsible for completing the major declaration form (available in the College) and for obtaining the signature of the chair or director of the undergraduate program. Students are responsible for checking their major requirements in SIS prior to graduation to be sure all requirements show as satisfied. EHD undergraduates double majoring in the College are required only to satisfy the general education requirements of the School of Education and Human Development. Second Major within the School of Education and Human Development B.S.Ed. candidates may apply to add a second major within the School of Education and Human Development. Courses from the primary EHD major may not be double-counted toward the fulfillment of second EHD major. In pursuing the above, the student will not receive two degrees from the University. The student receives a B.S.Ed. from the School of Education and Human Development. The second major designation appears as degree information on the official transcript. This information does not appear on the diploma. Students are responsible for checking their major requirements in SIS prior to graduation to be sure all requirements show as satisfied. Second Major in the Batten School Only Youth and Social Innovation majors may apply to double major with the Batten School. Minor(s) Undergraduate students may be accepted into no more than two minors at the University. Courses taken for the minor(s) can double count for Competencies and Area (General Education) requirements. Students are not permitted to double count courses to satisfy major and minor requirements. Credits applied toward a minor may not also count toward completion of a second minor. Students are responsible for completing the minor declaration form and for obtaining the signature of the chair or director of the undergraduate program. EHD students must submit the declaration form to the EHD Registrar or Academic Coordinator to have the minor added to their record. Students are responsible for checking their minor requirements in SIS prior to graduation to be sure all requirements show as satisfied. Public Professional Licensure Disclosure As a member of the State Authorizations Reciprocity Agreement, the University of Virginia (UVA) is authorized to provide curriculum in a distance learning environment to students located in all states in the United States except for California. (34 CFR 668.43(a)(6)& 34 CFR 668.72(n)). Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science in Education in Early Childhood Education at the UVA School of Education and Human Development, graduates may be eligible for initial professional licensure in another U.S. state by applying to the licensing board or agency in that state. Please visit the University’s state authorization web pages to make an informed decision regarding which states’ educational requirements for initial licensure are met by this program. (668.43(a)(5) (v)(A) - (C)) Enrolled students who change their current (or mailing) address to a state other than Virginia should update this information immediately in the Student Information System as it may impact their ability to complete internship, practicum, or clinical hours, use Title IV funds, or meet licensure or certification requirements in the new state. (34 CFR 668.402). Course Rules Accelerated Study Accelerated study is available to students entering with AP or dual-enrollment credits. Students who wish to finish their undergraduate studies in fewer than four years must work closely with their advisors to map a program of study. At least 60 credits of coursework must be taken on Grounds at the University of Virginia. Students who complete the undergraduate course requirements in three years or less are inducted into the Order of the Orange and are provided orange stoles to wear at final exercises. Those interested in accelerated graduate study at EHD in Kinesiology must apply for admission to the desired graduate program at the start of their last semester of undergraduate enrollment. All requirements (e.g., GREs, letters of recommendation, on-line application) must be submitted at that point. If admitted to the graduate program, a new advisor will be assigned. Undergraduate courses, or courses previously applied toward an undergraduate degree, are not transferable for credit toward a graduate degree. Changes in Schedule Changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS. Students may add and drop courses through the deadlines stated in the current Schedule of Classes. Course Absence Regulations Students are expected to attend classes throughout the session, with the exception of University academic holidays, unless permission to be absent temporarily or to withdraw has been first granted by the instructor. The Department of Student Health does not furnish routine excuses for illness either to the student or to the instructor. If a student anticipates extended absences for personal, health, or family emergencies, they should contact the advisor and/or the academic dean who will notify course faculty, as appropriate. Upon request from the academic dean, the Department of Student Health may evaluate the effect of any illness upon a student’s attendance and academic performance. Failure to attend classes or other prescribed activities in a course may result in enforced withdrawal from the course or other penalties as determined by the instructor. Course Load Students must be enrolled on a full-time basis (12 credits minimum) during all semesters, except the final one. Students should obtain permission from the advisor and academic dean in order to take fewer than 12, or more than 18 credits during a given semester.\\xa0 Reduced course loads in semesters other than the final one will only be granted in cases of extenuating medical or personal circumstances. Students will pay full-time tuition if they register for more than six credits. Any student that does not maintain enrollment and does not have an approved leave of absence will be required to reapply for admission and is not guaranteed acceptance. Discontinuing a Course A student may drop and void registration in a course within the official add/drop window via SIS. Permission to take fewer than 12 credits must be petitioned to, and approved by the advisor, program coordinator, and the academic dean. Exceptions can be granted only for unusual or emergency circumstances. Students may withdraw from a course after the add/drop window until the university’s official withdrawal date and will be graded as a Withdrawal (W). This notation does not affect a student’s grade point average; nor does a course with a grade of W count toward credits earned. Students may not withdraw from a course after the withdrawal date. Independent Study and Directed Research Students may earn a maximum of 6 credits through directed independent study or directed research credits. Students must complete an independent study contract for each\\xa0 independent study or directed research course and have appropriate approvals from the faculty supervisor, faculty advisor, and the program coordinator prior to enrolling. Independent study or directed research courses are taken ungraded (S/U) and cannot serve in lieu of required general education requirements or major requirements. Repeated Courses A student may choose to repeat a course for various reasons (example: to meet graduate school requirements). Beginning with the Fall 2024 semester, certain grades will not be used in calculation of the GPA. Specifically: an undergraduate student who has earned a grade of D+, D, D-, or F in a course during their time at UVA may take that course a second time, and the following applies: Both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. Only the higher of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA, with the following restrictions: This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated. This GPA adjustment applies only to cases where both the original and the repeat course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester All grades received will appear on the transcript, including those that are not used in calculation of the GPA. Two essentially identical courses offered under the same course number may not both be counted for degree credit. Thus, repeated courses will only count once for degree credit. Students who fail a course required for their major must repeat it and pass to obtain credit. Additionally: an undergraduate student who earned C- or higher in a course during their time at UVA may take that course a second time and the following applies: Both courses and their respective grades will appear on the transcript. The first course grade (C- and above) will be calculated in the cumulative grade point average (GPA). Two essentially identical courses offered under the same course number may not both be counted for degree credit. Thus, repeated courses will only count once for degree credit. Original and repeated courses must maintain the same grading basis. Degree Information Degree Requirements The School of Education and Human Development affirms the distinction between degree requirements and licensure requirements in its programs. While many programs contain both kinds of requirements, and major portions of the two may be synonymous, one may meet one set of requirements and not the other (i.e., receive a degree without qualifying for recommendation for licensure). Information concerning licensure requirements is provided to students through the Office of Teacher Education. To be recommended by the School of Education and Human Development for professional licensure, a student must complete a state-approved teacher education program sequence approved by the faculty of the School of Education and Human Development, meet state testing requirements, and fulfill all state-mandated licensure requirements. Final Examinations Final Examinations Final examinations are an essential part of most courses. They are given during a designated period of time at the end of each semester, as they are considered part of the regular academic calendar. Absence from exams is excused only for illness, attested to by a physician’s certificate, or for other causes that the instructor, advisor, and academic dean, by special action, may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a failure and, at the discretion of the instructor, may result in failing the course. Examinations may only be given at the University-assigned time unless authorized by the academic dean. Students are not authorized to take final exams before the regularly scheduled time. However, under serious conditions, and with their instructor and advisor’s permission, students may be allowed to postpone the examination to a time convenient to the instructor. Students who have three exams in one day or four in a two-day period may petition to have one examination moved using EHD’s form for final exam postponement requests. Requests must be approved prior to the last day of classes. Grades Course Grades All required courses must be taken for regular, graded credit (no S/U or CR/NC), including grades of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-. C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F. Internships, practica, and student teaching are generally graded S/U. Courses taken at or above the 5000 level may require a grade of B- or better if they are core courses or if students wish to apply said coursework toward a graduate degree program. Student work may be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis in certain courses within EHD. This is typically the case with practicums/field experiences. Students should consult their advisor and program coordinator before signing up for S/U courses to ensure such courses will count toward the 120-credit hours required for graduation. Credit/No Credit Grades A maximum of 24 credits of CR/NC courses may be used toward a degree. No more than 6 credits can be taken in a single semester, with the exception of Teacher Education majors, who will take 12 credits in the student teaching semester. Grade Changes No grade may be changed after it has been submitted to the University Registrar without the approval of the EHD academic dean. The EHD academic dean is not authorized by the faculty to change a grade submitted to the University Registrar except when an instructor certifies that, because of errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted. All grade changes must be entered into SIS. Incomplete Grades B.S.Ed. students may only request an incomplete grade if the instructor indicates that the student has successfully completed at least 75% of the work for the class.\\xa0 Students must complete the petition for an incomplete grade request form and have it signed by their instructor and submitted to their academic dean for final approval. The deadline to submit a completed form is the final day of the examination period. An IN may not be used to allow a student to attempt to raise a grade at the end of the term. The timeline to complete course work may not exceed 30 days, unless a student enters into a written contract with an instructor, specifying remaining requirements and the expected date of completion. If the student does not meet the terms of the incomplete policy, the student’s incomplete grade will be changed to an F or U. Intra-University Transfers Transfer to the School of Education and Human Development from another University of Virginia School Students can apply to internally transfer to EHD from another UVA school. See the Undergraduate Application Website for deadlines, program requirements, and the application process. Leaving and Returning to the University Entering Students Whose Medical Circumstances Preclude Enrollment Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in EHD before the semester begins must return to the University via the University of Virginia Admission Office, either as a deferred admission or as a transfer student.\\xa0 Students deferred by the Admission Office may enroll in courses elsewhere with the permission of the Admission Office.\\xa0 Transfer students must complete at least 24 semester credits of college work prior to matriculation. Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in EHD after the first day of the semester must withdraw from the University.\\xa0 They may return in accordance with EHD policy on re-admission. Students who withdraw from the semester may take courses elsewhere with the prior permission of the student’s advisor and the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs, and in accordance with existing policies on transfer credit. Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Further Information on Withdrawal For further information about voluntary withdrawal, medical withdrawal, and enforced withdrawal please see the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 Students receiving financial aid should consult Student Financial Services for additional information.\\xa0 Any questions about tuition and fees for withdrawn students should be directed to Student Financial Services. Leave of Absence The University expects students to register each semester and proceed to the completion of their degree programs.\\xa0 However, students may request to take a leave of absence, which is valid for up to two consecutive semesters.\\xa0 Students who plan to be away from the University in a subsequent semester (or semesters)\\xa0should contact the Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and\\xa0Student Affairs no later than the day before the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to be on leave. To request a leave of absence students use the Leaving the University eForm in the SIS Student Center. Students who have been on an approved leave of absence apply to return using the Return to the University process (see below).\\xa0 Students who enter a degree program at another institution, however, must reapply to the University as transfer students and are not guaranteed acceptance. Medical Withdrawal Due to significant medical reasons, a student may need to withdraw from the semester.\\xa0 A student may withdraw for medical reasons at any point in the semester, with the same conditions and restrictions applying as with a voluntary withdrawal (see below).\\xa0 In addition, students who return to EHD after a medical withdrawal must be cleared by Student Health (see Returning to the University\\xa0below).\\xa0 In very unusual medical circumstances, documented by a health professional, an EHD student who did not withdraw during the semester has one semester in which to petition for a retroactive medical withdrawal.\\xa0 If approved, all grades convert to W’s and the student is obliged to be absent for a full semester before resuming full-time study. Returning to the University In order to initiate the return to the university process, a student’s account must be cleared of any holds. Undergraduate students wishing to return to the University after a period of fewer than twenty-four continuous months should reach out to the EHD Office of Admissions and Student Affairs, as well as the coordinator for their degree program to discuss their plan of study. Students then complete the Returning to the University eForm in SIS. Medical clearance documentation will be required for students returning from a medical withdrawal. Students wishing to return to the University following an absence of twenty-four continuous months or longer or returning from suspension must prepare an application composed of the following materials to present to the\\xa0Senior Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Student Affairs: 1) a personal statement that addresses the student’s readiness to return to the University in light of any serious difficulties or extenuating circumstances related to his/her absence; 2) the student’s academic plan for his/her remaining semesters; 3) completion of the Returning to the University eForm in SIS; and 4) medical clearance documentation, if applicable. Students must also meet with the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs\\xa0and their degree program coordinator to create a plan of study. There is no guarantee that a petition to return to the university will be approved. International students must consult with the International Studies Office (ISO) upon seeking readmission. Qualified members of the United States armed forces have certain rights under state and federal law when their education is interrupted for a service connected reason and should consult the Undergraduate Record, Graduate Record, and/or Virginia’s Office of the Attorney General for additional information. Students who are subject to the Contributory Mental/Medical Disorder (CMD) review process should consult the Office of the Dean of Students on the process of returning to the University. The deadline for completing the Returning to the University process is May 1 to return for the summer semester, July 1 to return for the fall semester, and December 1 to return for the spring semester Information regarding the medical clearance documentation process through Student Health and Wellness: https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/re-enrollment See the University Regulations—Academic: Leaving and Returning section of this Record for additional policies that govern a student’s return. Voluntary Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period,\\xa0if they meet the conditions stated in the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 A grade of W will be entered for each course in which the student was registered.\\xa0 However, students in the School of Education and Human Development who withdraw within 10 class days immediately preceding the final examination period are not permitted to re-enter the University for the succeeding semester nor to present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 Students who have received a withdrawal notation on their transcript for two consecutive academic terms (not including Summer Session or J-Term), regardless of the lapse of time between the two terms, may not apply for readmission to the University for one year.\\xa0 Students initiate the withdrawal process with the EHD’s academic dean. Majors and Minors Majors The following majors and minors are offered within the School of Education and Human Development. Please see the EHD website for specific information. Kinesiology Kinesiology refers to the study of movement and is a multifaceted field of study in which movement or physical activity is the intellectual focus. Physical activity includes exercising for improvement of health and fitness; learning movement skills; and engaging in activities of daily living, work, sport, dance, and play. It involves the general population as well as special groups such as children and older adults; people with disabilities, injuries, or disease; and athletes. Speech Communication Disorders The undergraduate major in Speech Communication Disorders at the University of Virginia (a) introduces students to the fields of speech-language pathology and audiology and (b) provides pre-professional learning experiences to prepare students for graduate studies in either profession by emphasizing math, biological and behavioral sciences, basic human communication sciences, and critical thinking. Teacher Education - Early Childhood, Elementary, and Special Education The undergraduate majors in Early Childhood, Elementary, and Special Education prepare students for teacher licensure in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Students who successfully complete all requirements for these state-approved licensure programs are eligible for endorsement in one of the following area: early/primary preK-3; elementary preK-6; or special education - general curriculum K-12. During the teacher education program, students learn effective strategies for teaching diverse learners while practicing those strategies in P-12 classrooms. Youth & Social Innovation The undergraduate major in Youth & Social Innovation engages students in coursework that integrates theory and research on youth development, programming, and policy with hands-on application through community engagement. Students learn how to evaluate the effectiveness of existing social innovations for youth and collaborate with a team to design new ones. Minors Global Studies in Education The Global Studies in Education Minor is aimed at providing students with analytical approaches to comparative and international influences on educational processes and outcomes.\\xa0 The minor consists of 18 credits which includes two core courses and four electives. Health and Wellbeing Pan University The courses in this program are designed to assist students in obtaining the scientific knowledge related to health and wellbeing to promote intelligent decision-making. It also amplifies the curriculum for students who wish to work in the health or mental health professions, or hope to be engaged in public policy related to health and well-being. Nineteen credits are required. Study Abroad EHD supports numerous Study Abroad programs during which students grow academically and professionally while gaining a global perspective. Before pursuing any international learning experience for academic credit, students are required to discuss plans with the academic advisor, and if approved, meet with the International Studies Office (208 Minor Hall). Earning Undergraduate Credit for Study Abroad In order to be eligible students must have completed at least one full-time semester at the University of Virginia, possess a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or higher, and be in good academic and disciplinary standing prior to applying to study abroad. Students are also expected to meet with the academic advisor to plan a program of study, complete the online Education Abroad Workshop,\\xa0and meet with an Education Abroad Advisor in the International Studies Office. Coursework must be approved prior to enrolling in an institution outside of the U.S. Note that credit granted for courses taken abroad cannot exceed credits awarded for comparable University courses.* If enrolling abroad during a fall or spring semester, students are expected to complete at least 12 credits of coursework. To ensure students receive credit toward the degree, students must: Review information and policies found on the EHD Study Abroad page; Submit a completed EHD Study Abroad Transfer Credit Course Approval Form to 102 Ridley Hall; and Send official transcripts immediately after completing transfer coursework to Transfer Credits, P.O. Box 400261, Charlottesville, VA\\xa0 22904. Requests for transfer credit from international students returning to their home countries to study in the summer will be treated like those from U.S. students who will be studying at U.S. institutions for transfer credit. * UVA applies the general guidelines for awarding credit recommended by the National Council on the Evaluation of Foreign Student Credentials and the national Association for Foreign Student Affairs.\\xa0 Students receive credit for courses taken at recognized foreign tertiary-level educational institutions.\\xa0 Those that are chartered and authorized by their respective national governments (generally through ministries of education) are considered “recognized.” Transfer Credit Credits Earned Prior to Admission A maximum of 60 credits may be earned prior to matriculation.\\xa0 These may include transfer credits approved by the University, AP credits, International College-level exams, and dual enrollment coursework taken in high school.\\xa0After admission, if the course(s) taken are not listed in the transfer credit database , students must complete the Undergraduate Transfer Credit Form and submit it to the EHD Admissions Office, 102 Ridley Hall. Credits Earned After Admission to EHD An EHD undergraduate student may take coursework at another accredited degree-granting institution of higher education in the U.S. or abroad and transfer those credits to UVA.\\xa0 Students must seek permission before beginning the coursework elsewhere by submitting the Undergraduate Transfer Credit form. If the course is listed in transfer credit database , enter the course and its equivalent on the form.\\xa0 If not listed, consult the EHD Academic Coordinator for guidance.\\xa0 Transfer credits are evaluated and must be approved by the EHD advisor and Academic Coordinator (use separate forms for each institution).\\xa0Upon successful completion of the course(s) earning a grade of C or better students can request credits to transfer. Students must provide an official transcript to the EHD Office of Admissions (within 2 months).\\xa0 Failure to provide official transcript(s) and doing so within this time frame will prevent the course from being added to the official transcript. Courses passed with an S, P, or credit grading option will transfer only upon verification that they represent work equivalent to a C or better.\\xa0 Such courses will be counted toward total Credit/Non-Credit courses allowed in the degree program.\\xa0Quarter hours will be reduced proportionally to their semester hour equivalent.\\xa0 If students previously earned credit at UVA for an equivalent course, duplicate credit will not be awarded. No more than 60 non-UVA credits (including transfer and Advanced Standing credit) can count toward the degree at UVA.

International Student Admission For the 2023-24 and 2024-25 application years, UVA has adopted a Test Optional admission policy that includes international students. Students whose first language is not English or who have attended an English-speaking school for fewer than two years are encouraged to provide evidence of their English proficiency by submitting the results of the TOEFL or the IELTS. We strongly encourage all applicants whose first language is not English to participate in an English language assessment, regardless of their secondary school education. Please contact InitialView or Vericant to schedule your evaluation. This evaluation is an opportunity to display your communication skills, reasoning abilities, and your enthusiasm for becoming a successful student at the University of Virginia. No other interviews are offered. Academic Advising Advisory System Collaboration and personal attention mark the relations between engineering faculty members and students. All new incoming first year students are assigned a Faculty Advisor who typically serves as one of their instructors in the first semester.\\xa0 These faculty members in the School of Engineering and Applied Science aid entering students in the transition to college life and in furthering their academic and career interests. Each first-year student consults with their faculty advisor about course and major selection, and other academic requirements. Transfer students and first years who declare a major in their second semester are assigned an advisor in the department administering the degree program. The departmental advisor helps the student create a plan to successfully complete the curriculum and serves as a resource for other academic matters and career interests. Students are expected to meet with their advisor once in the fall and once in the spring to plan their course of study.\\xa0 Advisors typically remove the advising hold in the Student Information System only after they have met with a student. Students are also encouraged to contact their advisors for other matters related to academics, career planning, professional service, or to discuss any other matters.\\xa0 The School of Engineering and Applied Science Undergraduate Program Office provides assistance and serves as another source of information and academic guidance.\\xa0Students are ultimately responsible for their academic schedule and degree requirements and should run their Academic Requirement report regularly.\\xa0For additional support with advising, please contact your department’s Undergraduate Program Coordinator at the following link:\\xa0https://engineering.virginia.edu/undergraduate-study/current-undergrads/degree-information/majors-and-minors Academic Standing Academic Warning UVA Engineering believes in the importance of learning from academic setbacks and failure. \\xa0We use grade point averages at the end of the fall and spring semesters or two failing* grades in a required** course to identify students in need of support. \\xa0Therefore, following any fall or spring semester where a student receives a semester grade point average below 2.000, we put the student on Academic Warning and expect the student to engage in reflection through an Academic Success Plan and empower the student to form an Academic Success Team. Academic Suspension Students who were on academic warning\\xa0in Fall 2021\\xa0and after,\\xa0are suspended from the University following any semester in which both their current and cumulative GPA is below 2.000. We also use three failing * grades in a required ** course to identify students for suspension. The term of the first suspension is a one semester leave during the regular academic year.\\xa0 One full fall semester or one full spring semester must elapse following a student’s first suspension before they are eligible to apply to return to the University.\\xa0\\xa0Students can request permission in advance from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs to transfer 3-4 academic credits taken elsewhere while on academic suspension. Students academically suspended can avoid the one semester leave and remain\\xa0enrolled one (1) semester by completing the Academic Recovery Plan.\\xa0 The Academic Recovery Plan consists of filling out a reflection, setting goals, and forming an Academic Success Team by the deadline\\xa0communicated in the academic suspension notification via email.\\xa0 Suspension in Abeyance will appear on the student’s transcript during the semester they choose to participate in the Academic Recovery Plan.\\xa0 During the semester of Academic Recovery, a student is required to document progress toward their set goals twice during the semester.\\xa0 If a student does not meet the Academic Recovery requirements during the semester, a SIS hold will be placed on their account which will affect their ability to register in\\xa0courses for\\xa0the following semester. Whether a student chooses to participate in Academic Recovery or take the one semester leave, the student is still considered to be on their first suspension.\\xa0 After a student is placed on their first suspension, at the end of that or any subsequent\\xa0fall or spring semester where their term\\xa0grade point average (GPA) and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is below a 2.0, they will be placed on their second\\xa0academic suspension, and will not be able to return to the University. * An NC earned under the COVID-19 Grading Policy does not count as failed. ** A “required” course is one that is specified by their program of study or by the general education requirements of the School of Engineering as being required of all students to earn a degree. A student can apply for reenrollment from first suspension through the Return to University form in SIS (bottom left) and follow the deadlines under Reenrollment . The student should briefly describe their activities since suspension and future academic goals. Students returning from academic suspension will be required to meet with their advisor and a representative from the Engineering Undergraduate Programs Office to develop an academic success plan.\\xa0 The Undergraduate Office will put a hold on the student’s record if they do not create an academic success plan.\\xa0 The academic success plan will require monthly documentation of progress toward goals and may include a mid-semester grade update.\\xa0 Students must be readmitted to the School of their previous enrollment. That is, even if a student plans to transfer from UVA Engineering to another undergraduate school at the University, the student must first be readmitted to UVA Engineering. A second suspension is final, and the student is not allowed to return to the University. Appeals from Students Appeal of Academic Suspension Students who are subject to academic suspension\\xa0according to the policies of the School of Engineering and Applied Science will be notified in writing, via email, by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs. The deadline for appeal will be clearly stated in the communication from the Associate Dean about the suspension. Students have the right to appeal the suspension\\xa0to the School of Engineering and Applied Science designated official which is the Assistant Dean for Undergradaute Affairs by submitting\\xa0an Academic Standards Petition and\\xa0emailing the form to engineering-undgrad@virginia.edu .\\xa0 The Assistant Dean will collect information from the student and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs.\\xa0 Within thirty (30) calendar days after initially receiving the appeal in writing, the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Affairs will put their decision in writing to the student and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs.\\xa0 Appeals must contain a cover sheet, a narrative letter addressing any mitigating circumstances, a current unofficial transcript and may include any medical documentation and/or supporting documentation from advisors, instructors, or others with knowledge of the situation. Within five (5) calendar days after receiving the decision, the student may appeal that decision by revising their petition and ask that it be sent to the dean’s designee, the Committee on Academic Standard (CAS).\\xa0 The committee is comprised of faculty members representing the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\\xa0 The action by the committee on the appeal is final in as much as the committee acts for the full UVA Engineering faculty in these matters. The committee’s decision will be communicated to the student within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the revised petition, including new academic standing.\\xa0 The committee’s decision is final; there is no further mechanism for appeal.\\xa0 Students should refer to PROV-019: Student Academic Suspension Grievance Policy for the most current policy on record. Appeal of Grading Decisions Students who wish to appeal a grade in a course offered by the School of Engineering and Applied Science must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course.\\xa0Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student may submit a Grade Appeal Form to the Undergraduate Committee on Academic Standards by emailing the form to engineering-undgrad@virginia.edu.\\xa0 The appeal should include a description of the steps the student has taken to resolve the issue with the instructor and with their chair.\\xa0However, we strongly recommend students resolve the grade appeal with the course faculty member’s department chair.\\xa0 Contact the Engineering Undergraduate Program Office for contact information for the department chair – engineering-undgrad@virginia.edu . The appeal of a grade from a course offered during the fall term must be initiated by the student by March 1 of the following spring term; the appeal of a grade from a course offered during the spring or summer terms must be initiated by the student by October 1 of the following fall term.\\xa0The appeal of a grade from a course offered during a student’s final term before graduation must be appealed before graduation. Grade appeals should only relate to the process of how a final grade was computed, a disagreement over the quality of the student’s work is not sufficient grounds for an appeal. The student should include all documentation that the student deems relevant to the appeal at the time of submission. The committee will provide a written response to the student’s appeal within thirty (30) calendar days.\\xa0 The decision of the committee is final. Students who have questions about the grade appeal process or who wish to discuss any classroom issue may contact the Undergraduate Programs Office. Appeal for Retroactive Medical Withdraw In extreme medical circumstances, documented by a medical professional, a student can submit an appeal for a Retroactive Medical Withdraw through the Committee on Academic Standards (CAS).\\xa0 If approved, all grades for the specified semester will convert to a ‘W.’\\xa0 In some cases, CAS may require a student to sit out the following semester based on the withdrawal policy. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List Full-time students who demonstrate academic excellence while taking a minimum of 15 credits of graded course work are eligible for the Dean’s List of at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Courses taken on a CR/NC basis are not counted toward the 15-credit minimum.\\xa0 A current minimum grade point average of 3.400 is necessary to be eligible for the Dean’s List.\\xa0 Any student receiving an F, NC, or NG during the semester is not eligible to be on the Dean’s List.\\xa0 Students who qualify will receive the notation of “Dean’s List” on their transcript within several weeks after the conclusion of the semester. Graduation Honors Degrees are conferred “with distinction” for students who graduate with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.400, “with high distinction” for a cumulative GPA of at least 3.600, or “with highest distinction” for a cumulative GPA of at least 3.800. UVA Engineering Outstanding Student Award Students that have demonstrated excellent academic performance, leadership, and service are nominated annually to receive the UVA Engineering Outstanding Student Award. The award is one of UVA Engineering’s highest student honors. Curricular Requirements The first year of study at the School of Engineering and Applied Science is spent garnering a solid background in the sciences and mathematics. Toward the end of the first year, students declare\\xa0a major in one of eleven programs in engineering or applied science. In February of your first year, look for an email explaining how you declare your major. Throughout the curriculum, students take\\xa0courses in natural science (chemistry and physics), applied science (computer programming, applied mathematics, and various courses in engineering science), as well as social science (STS 2600, STS 4500, and social science electives) and humanities courses (STS 4600 and Humanities Electives). Specifically, the courses below comprise the general education requirements in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, fulfilled throughout the undergraduate career through course transfer, placement, or course completion. 4 credits –\\xa0Engineering Foundations 1 (ENGR 1010) 3 credits – Engineering Foundations 2 (ENGR 1020) 4 credits - Single Variable Calculus II (APMA 1110) 4 credits – Multi-variable Calculus III (APMA 2120) 4 credits - Gen Chemistry I & Lab (CHEM 1410/1411) 9 credits - Science, Technology, & Society Courses (STS 2600, STS 4500, and STS 4600) 3 credits – Introduction to Programming (CS 1110, CS 1111, CS 1112, and CS 1113) 4 credits – General Physics I & Lab (PHYS 1425/1429) 9 credits – Humanities or Social Science Electives (see Elective Courses for more details) 3 credits – Math/Science Elective I (go to the following link for more details: Math and Science Electives I ) All incoming first-year students are required to complete a math placement exam.\\xa0 Students who place into Single Variable Calculus I (APMA 1090) are strongly encouraged to complete this course, but it is not required. The last three years are spent specializing in a chosen area and taking further courses in the general field of engineering. Successful graduates can expect a wide range of career opportunities in engineering, business, law, and medicine. Elective Courses The curricula include elective courses designed either as “humanities or social science (HSS) elective,” “technical elective,” or “unrestricted elective.” HSS electives are selected from an approved list of humanities and social science offerings. Communication courses in the student’s native or first language, regardless of their level, may not be used to satisfy this requirement. Technical electives are chosen from engineering or applied science, science, or mathematics courses not normally required in the student’s curriculum. Approved technical electives vary by program, and students should consult their program’s regulations regarding acceptable courses for technical elective credit. Unrestricted electives may be chosen from any graded course in the University except the following:\\xa0 (1) mathematics courses below MATH 1310, (2) STAT 1100 and 1120, and (3) courses that substantially duplicate any others offered for the degree, including PHYS 2010, PHYS 2020, CS 1010, and CS 1020.\\xa0 Students in doubt as to what is acceptable to satisfy a degree requirement should obtain the approval of their advisor and the dean’s office, A122 Thornton Hall. APMA 1090 counts as a three-credit unrestricted elective. Students are expected to consult with their advisor to arrive at an acceptable overall program of electives. All electives should be chosen to meet an objective rather than at random. Exceptions to the general education curriculum for individual students must be approved by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs. Exceptions to the curriculum requirements of individual degree programs must be approved by the Undergraduate Director\\xa0of that program. Students should complete an Engineering Curriculum Modification Request form in either case. ROTC Programs The regular curricula can be supplemented to include Air, Military, or Naval Science courses. Depending on the ROTC branch and degree program, such a curriculum may take more than eight semesters to complete. Course Rules Attendance Regular attendance in classes is a vital part of the educational process. At the University of Virginia, each student is expected to attend all lectures, laboratories, quizzes, and practical exercises, subject to absence penalties specified by the instructor. Absences traditionally excused are those that occur because of illness or death in a student’s family, important religious holidays, or authorized University activities, such as field trips or University sponsored events, or personal illness. Students who anticipate absence for cause should obtain permission from the instructor in advance of the absence; unforeseen absences resulting from sickness or other circumstances considered to be emergencies may be excused by the instructor, and arrangements may be made with the instructor to complete the assignments missed. UVA Engineering students taking courses in the College or other schools of the University are governed by the attendance regulations of the instructor in that division; unexcused absences from such courses are subject to the penalties prescribed. Completion of Prerequisite Courses The sequences of required courses leading to various engineering degrees are carefully arranged to ensure that a student who enters any course may be expected to receive maximum benefit from the course. A student who failed a course may not normally enroll for any course that lists the failed course as a prerequisite before satisfactorily completing that course. Under unusual circumstances, exceptions may be made. Exceptions to override a prerequisite will require\\xa0written justification from the student and permission from the instructor through a Course Action form. Course Enrollment Except for students in extended programs or for special arrangements approved by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs, each student in the School of Engineering and Applied Science must enroll for all courses required by the curriculum of the program department in which the student is enrolled. Substitutions of courses completed elsewhere by students entering with advanced standing must be approved by the Associate Dean (in consultation with the departmental faculty concerned when necessary). Students making normal progress toward their degree may graduate under the curriculum enforced at the time they entered the school. However, because curricula change to keep pace with evolving technologies and new disciplines, students may be required to substitute courses that the faculty designate as equivalent. Each student is responsible for the selection of their own program, the fulfillment of prerequisites, and the scheduling of all courses required by their program curriculum. The student’s academic advisor is always available with assistance, but the duty of enrolling in and completing the full degree requirements rests primarily with the student. Course Load Full Time: A full-time undergraduate course load is 12 credits. An average of 16 graded credits per semester is recommended for a student to graduate within 8 semesters of study. This is because many degree programs in Engineering require 128 graded credits in total. Students should check the requirements of their degree program and should always consult their academic advisor to determine the appropriate course selection for each semester. Overload: A proposed overload amounting to 20 or more credits must be approved by a faculty advisor and by the Office of Undergraduate Programs. Demonstrated superior academic performance and clear career planning will be the major criteria for approval.\\xa0 Students in their first semester will not be permitted to enroll in more than 19 credits. Temporary Reduced Course Load and Part Time: It is sometimes beneficial for\\xa0students to take less than a full-time course load. Reduced course load is defined as greater than 6 credits and less than 12 credits, while part-time is defined as 6 credits or less. A Reduced course load\\xa0still bears full-time tuition and fees, while part-time enrollment is paid by the credit hour.\\xa0 Students must submit a request form to seek permission to enroll in a reduced course load, or part-time for a semester.\\xa0 The request process requires permission approval from the students academic advisor and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs.\\xa0 Additional approval is required for student athletes and international students.\\xa0 Students should consult with Student Financial Services prior to requesting a temporary\\xa0reduced course load or part-time enrollment.\\xa0 Student housing and student worker eligibility may be impacted by enrolling in less than 12 credits (full-time). Dropping a Course A student may drop and void registration in a course any time up to the official drop date, unless such action reduces the number of graded credits for which the student is registered to fewer than 12.\\xa0 Students who wish to drop below 12 credits must appeal to the Associate\\xa0Dean of Undergraduate Affairs prior to the official drop date of the term. Enforced Withdrawal from a Course With the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs, faculty may impose enforced withdrawal with a notation of W on the transcript as a penalty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes implied by registration in the University. Extension of a Course After the official withdrawal date,\\xa0a student can no longer withdraw from a course. If there are extenuating circumstances, and if it is feasible, a student may petition for a course extension. Feasibility is determined after a review of the outstanding work, the availability of the instructor, the accessibility of laboratory facilities, and other practical considerations.\\xa0 If approved, all work must be completed within 30 days from the grading deadline of the term.\\xa0 Extensions past 30 days must be approved by the instructor and communicated to the Undergraduate Programs Office. Graduate Courses Undergraduates may seek permission to take 6000-level series courses in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Undergraduates must be approved by their advisor and the instructor of the course in order to be permitted to enroll in a 6000-level graduate course.\\xa0 5000-level courses are open to all fourth-year undergraduates. Laboratory Courses To register for or attend any laboratory course, a student must be registered or have credit for the associated lecture course. If the associated courses are taken concurrently and the lecture course is dropped, the laboratory course may be continued for credit only with permission of the laboratory instructor. Repeating Courses Students may be required to repeat courses they have failed or passed with low grades, as determined by program-specific policies.\\xa0Students should consult with their academic advisor for clear guidance about when a course must be repeated. When students repeat a course in which they initially earned D+, D, D-, or an F, they should consult the university policy on repeating courses . Regardless of whether the student is required or chooses to repeat the course, the University policy stipulates that if a student earns D+, D, D-, or an F in a course and takes the course the second time for credit, only the highest grade will be included in the grade point average; however, both grades will appear on the student’s transcript. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated and where both the original and the repeated course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. This policy starts in Fall 2024 and unfortunately courses repeated in prior semesters are not eligible for this adjustment. When the repeated grade is C- or above both grades for a repeated course are used in the computation for the grade point average, and both grades appear on the student’s transcript. C- always fulfills pre-requisite requirements for undergraduate courses. Required Courses Courses specified in each degree curriculum are required, and changes or substitution are not ordinarily permitted. Any student who either drops or fails a required course must register anew for that specific course (or for its successor in case the original is no longer offered) and repeat the content in its entirety. Withdrawing from a Course After the drop deadline, a student can submit a course withdrawal request in SIS prior to the course withdrawal deadline. Drop and course withdrawal deadlines can be found under the Academic Calendar on the University Registrar’s website. A student who is permitted to withdraw from a particular course will receive a W for the course. Requests to withdraw below 12 credits must\\xa0be approved by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs prior to the course withdrawal deadline.\\xa0 In the event of emergency and/or exigent circumstances, students may petition\\xa0the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs to withdraw from a course after the course withdrawal deadline has passed (Request for Late Course Withdrawal). Poor performance unrelated to emergency and/or exigent circumstances is not sufficient to request a late course withdrawal. No course withdrawal requests will be approved after final grades have been submitted. Degree Information Degree Requirements To qualify for a baccalaureate degree, a student must have satisfied\\xa0credit for all required and elective courses included in their program. In addition, the student must have maintained a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.000. Regular programs leading to the various degrees are detailed under the departmental listings. The student should become familiar with the requirements of his or her chosen area of study. Students are expected to declare\\xa0their\\xa0major area of study at the end of the second semester but may change majors at a later date. Courses with the Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) grading basis may not be used to satisfy requirements for a major or minor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Students should\\xa0verify the grading basis of all courses prior to the add deadline for the term.\\xa0 More information about the CR/NC grading basis can be found under “Grades.” Courses completed through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) may not be used to satisfy any degree requirements in the School of\\xa0Engineering and Applied Science. Residence Requirements A recipient of a degree in engineering or applied science must have been in residence for two academic years in this University, and registered in the School of Engineering and Applied Science during the semester in which they receive\\xa0a degree.\\xa0 Fifty percent of the course requirements for a student’s primary academic degree program must be satisfied in residence at the University of Virginia. Graduation A student will graduate when credit for all required and elective courses for their primary academic degree program is satisfied, and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.000.\\xa0 Students must apply for graduation in the Student Information System (SIS) by the add deadline in their final term. \\xa0Students may not delay their graduation in order to complete a second major and/or minor.\\xa0 Students may not continue to enroll in classes after their degree is\\xa0conferred unless they have been accepted to another degree program at the University, or apply as a visiting non-degree student. Only students whose official graduation date is May will be permitted to participate in UVA Engineering diploma ceremonies. Students who, during their last spring semester, withdraw\\xa0from a course or fail a course that is required to fulfill any graduation requirement will not be permitted to participate in UVA Engineering diploma ceremonies. Also, per University rule, no student with an IN on their record (from their last spring semester or earlier semesters) will be permitted to graduate until the IN is resolved and all degree requirements are satisfied. Students whose official graduation date is August or December will be invited to participate in Final Exercises the following May. Grades Credit/No Credit Grades In some courses, students have the option of receiving the grades CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of the regular grades, A through F. This option may be selected when students register for the course, and the course instructor has the right to deny students permission to take the course on a CR/NC basis. The grading basis cannot be changed after the semester add deadline. Courses taken for CR/NC may not be used for any major or degree requirements. Only courses that are not part of the degree program may be taken CR/NC. Intra-University Transfers UVA Engineering will have two transfer application deadlines per year,\\xa0in December and June. In order to be eligible for intra-University transfer (IUT,) applicants must demonstrate a history of success in a technical curriculum. Students without a demonstrated history of success and progress toward an engineering degree will not be accepted for transfer. Students will declare their major on their transfer application. There are no “caps” on majors and no separate process to apply into a major.\\xa0 All students accepted for transfer are placed into their major of choice. For details and the application, visit UVA Engineering Intra-University Transfer . Leaving and Returning to the University Leaving the University Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their absence from the university.\\xa0 The University withdrawal form is located on the SIS\\xa0Student Self Service page menu under\\xa0eForms.\\xa0 The form is titled Leaving the University (Leaves, Withdrawals, and Transfers). Leave of Absence is an action students can take after the completion of a semester, indicating that the student plans to be away from the university for at least one semester.\\xa0Students with an approved Leave of Absence may still be required to observe academic sanctions resulting from their academic standing. Withdrawal is an action students can take during the semester. All registered courses will show a W, indicating withdrawal. If a student withdraws within 8 weeks prior to the starting day of the next semester, the student may not attend\\xa0the University during that semester. For example, withdrawing during the fall term in December precludes a student from enrolling in J-term and spring semesters, and the student may apply to reenroll (see below) for the summer and/or fall term. Students on leave from the University are not permitted to enroll in transfer courses without prior approval from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs. Application for reenrollment from a leave of absence or withdrawal must be made using the Returning to the University form on the SIS Student Self Service page menu\\xa0under\\xa0eForms. Refer to the Reenrollment section below for additional information. Reenrollment Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their reenrollment at the University. Engineering students must submit the Returning to the University form by April 1 for the summer semester, July 1 for the fall semester,\\xa0and December 1 for the January Term or the spring semester. Late applications will not be accepted.\\xa0\\xa0The Returning to the University form is located on the SIS Student Self Service page menu under eForms. Students wishing to return from an absence of 24 continuous months or longer will need additional approval from the Provost’s Committee on Student Readmission.\\xa0 The Undergraduate Programs Office will submit the appeal to return on the student’s behalf.\\xa0 No additional steps are required by the student. Majors and Minors All students in UVA Engineering have one primary major.\\xa0 First-year students are classified as “undeclared”, and they declare their major in their second semester by March 1 to receive advising in major specific coursework and enrollment.\\xa0 “Undeclared” is not a degree program and students cannot graduate from UVA Engineering while undeclared.\\xa0 Students can elect to pursue a second major in UVA Engineering or other qualifying schools of the University but are limited to a primary major in engineering and one second major.\\xa0 Pursuing a second major\\xa0is only recommended for students with strong academic records containing evidence of success during semesters with heavy course load. Students may elect to pursue minors in UVA Engineering or in other qualifying schools of the University, but they are limited to two (2) minors.\\xa0 If a student wishes to pursue more than two minors, they may only do so with the approval by email of the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Affairs. UVA Engineering students must\\xa0request approval of additional majors and minors in UVA Engineering from the department that offers the majors and minors.\\xa0 For additional majors in the College, see the College Undergraduate Record for full details of their policies on earning majors and minors.\\xa0 Students in UVA Engineering cannot double major in the McIntire School of Commerce.\\xa0 However, students\\xa0can apply to transfer to the McIntire School of Commerce and potentially add a second major in engineering. Students will receive one diploma indicating their primary major.\\xa0 All other credentials (majors, minors, concentrations) appear on the academic transcript.

Admission Requirements Application of Policies Academic Advising Academic Standing Appeals from Students Awards for Academic Excellence Curricular Requirements Course Rules Degree Information Final Examinations Grades Intra-University Transfers Leaving and Returning to the University Majors and Minors Study Abroad Transfer Credit Admission Requirements Admission Requirements: Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership Open to UVA undergraduates and to transfer students, the Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership is a multidisciplinary, liberal arts program focused on understanding how public policy decisions are made, and how civic leaders in government, non-profit organizations, and the private sector contribute to collective problem solving. The curriculum provides an opportunity to learn about the political, economic, historical, and social context of public policy. The program also gives students the ability to understand debates about the full range of policy issues facing the contemporary world and introduces\\xa0basic concepts of policy analysis. Although not a pre-professional degree, the Batten undergraduate program gives students an opportunity to develop their critical and analytical thinking,\\xa0communication, leadership, and research skills. It is an excellent choice for students who are still exploring their career options, or who seek a broad introduction to the identification and management of contemporary societal problems and to the challenges and opportunities of civic leadership. Batten BA recipients are prepared for a wide range of graduate programs, including both professional degrees and doctoral programs, and\\xa0for jobs related to public policy in the for-profit, non-profit, and public sectors. Admission to the Batten School is competitive to ensure a well-rounded class and to limit class size. Typically, current UVA undergraduates apply for admission during the second year and will be admitted to the Batten School for their final two years. The program is also open to students transferring to the University in the third year who apply via the external transfer process administered by the University’s Office of Undergraduate Admission. The application for the undergraduate program can be found on the Batten School’s website . Applicants must demonstrate that they will have earned at least 60 undergraduate credits before matriculation into the program. In addition, prior to enrollment in the program, students must complete and earn a grade of ‘C’ or higher\\xa0in three\\xa0prerequisite courses: 1. ECON 2010 [Microeconomics]\\xa0or equivalent 2. LPPP 2200\\xa0[Introduction\\xa0to Public Policy] 3. LPPL 2600\\xa0[Foundations of Behavioral Science], or\\xa0PSYC 2600 [Introduction to Social Psychology], or equivalent. To be eligible for the Batten BA, students must first be admitted to the University of Virginia, either as first-year students or through the University’s transfer process. Students who transfer in their second year are\\xa0encouraged to complete at least one semester of coursework at the University before\\xa0to applying to Batten. Traditionally the Batten School considers applications to the BA program for the fall semester of a student’s third year, regardless of when they matriculate into the University. Exceptions to this timeline should be discussed with the Batten School Office of Admissions in advance, noted in the student’s application materials, and will be reviewed by the admission committee. In special circumstances, a student may apply for admission to the Batten School undergraduate degree program during their first year and complete the program over the course of their second and third year of study, thus graduating early. In such cases, the student must still fulfill the requirement of having completed 60 credits prior to entry to the Batten School and are expected to complete the curriculum over the course of two academic years. The Batten School General Education Requirements are the same as the UVA College of Arts and Sciences, and the Batten School will accept students from any of the general education curricular programs (Echols Scholars Program, Engagements Pathway, or Disciplines Plus Pathway). Applicants must present strong academic credentials and demonstrate that they are on track to finish their general education requirements by the end of their time in the Batten School. Admission Requirements: Accelerated Bachelor/MPP Students already committed to a career in public policy\\xa0who are interested in and exhibit academic readiness for a professional master’s degree in that field, are advised to consider applying to the Accelerated Bachelor/MPP Program. Visit the Graduate Record for the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy for information on the Accelerated Bachelor/MPP curriculum and application requirements. Admission Requirements: Public Policy and Leadership Minor Rooted in the social sciences, the minor focuses on public policy issues and decision-making processes through instruction in economic, political, historical, and psychological factors in public policy formulation and application. The minor consists of a core curriculum and specialized courses that emphasize substantive knowledge, analytical rigor, and research skills. It also introduces students to leadership theory and concepts. Current University of Virginia undergraduates, not enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership major, can apply for admission into the minor on the Batten School’s website . Prior to enrollment in the minor program, students must complete and earn a ‘C’ or higher in two prerequisite courses: 1. ECON 2010 or equivalent and 2. LPPL 2600, PSYC 2600, or equivalent. Students typically complete the requirements of the minor program over the course of two academic years; exceptions to this timeline should be discussed in advance with the Batten School Office of Admissions. Deferring Admission A UVA student admitted into the Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership, Accelerated Bachelor/Master of Public Policy, or Public Policy and Leadership Minor may petition to postpone enrollment in the Batten School due to extenuating circumstances. Requests to defer an offer of admission will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Disclosing Criminal History The University of Virginia strives to provide a safe living, learning, and working environment for all members of our community.\\xa0Although we do not ask candidates for admission into Batten to disclose criminal convictions or pending charges when they apply, current UVA students are required to disclose any arrests or convictions within 72 hours of such incident.\\xa0Failure to disclose criminal convictions or pending charges is grounds for revocation of an offer of admission. When an admitted student discloses a conviction or pending charge, Batten does not automatically withdraw admission. Rather, a University committee that represents varied interests evaluates the circumstances thoroughly and holistically and determines whether the student’s enrollment would be consistent with the safety of the University community. Rescinding an Offer of Admission It is the Batten School’s expectation that all applicants uphold the intellectual, ethical, and professional standards of the School and the University of Virginia.\\xa0By applying to the School, students agree to abide by the principles of the UVA Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct . The School may rescind an offer of admission up until the date of matriculation or by the end of the first semester in the Batten School if admission was conditional on corequisite requirements\\xa0for, but not limited to, the following reasons: An applicant fails to successfully complete any conditions of their admission or program prerequisites, including meeting the credit threshold required to enter a Batten program. An admitted applicant fails to show satisfactory academic progress in any courses completed after receiving their offer of admission. An applicant is found to have presented misleading or fraudulent information during the application process. An applicant fails to disclose an arrest, criminal conviction, or pending charge prior to matriculation. An applicant fails to follow the principles of the UVA Honor Code and the Standards of Conduct described above. Application of Policies Application of Batten School Policies Policies and procedures apply to all students enrolled in the Batten School, as stipulated below, and are subject to change. Petitions for exception should be addressed to the Batten Academic Standards Committee. Policies and procedures governing enrollment in a degree program or course at the Batten School also apply to students from other schools who are enrolled in Batten programs and courses. Application of Other School and University Policies Students enrolled in the first year of the Accelerated Master of Public Policy Program are still candidates for their undergraduate degrees. They are therefore governed by the regulations of the school in the University in which they are completing those degrees, as well as with the general policies of the University of Virginia, presented in the Undergraduate Record and available online at records.ureg.virginia.edu/ . Upon successful completion of the undergraduate degree and the first year of the Batten curriculum, these students will be officially admitted to the Batten School graduate program. Students may not be admitted to the graduate program without an undergraduate degree. Accelerated Master of Public Policy students not in good academic standing as defined below (Good Academic Standing: Accelerated Bachelor/MPP) at the end of the first year in the program will not matriculate into the Batten School for the second year of the graduate program. All students enrolled in the Batten School’s undergraduate program are responsible for complying with the policies of the University of Virginia, presented in the Undergraduate Record and available online at records.ureg.virginia.edu/ . All students enrolled in the Batten School’s graduate programs are responsible for complying with the policies of the University of Virginia, presented in the Graduate Record and available online at records.ureg.virginia.edu/ . The Graduate Record and the Undergraduate Record contain information on policies that apply to all University students, regulations governing undergraduate, graduate, and dual-degree programs, the Honor System, tuition, fees, and financial aid. Academic Advising Academic Advising The Academic Operations team\\xa0is responsible for the academic advising of Batten School students in the undergraduate major and minor. The Batten academic advisors\\xa0meet\\xa0with students regularly to monitor curricular progress, and administers school policies with regard to student retention, degree progress, academic probation, and graduation status. Academic Standing Academic Standing At the end of each semester, the Academic Standards Committee reviews the academic records of all Batten students to see if they are in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress toward their degree. This review ensures that students are informed of academic problems in a timely way. The\\xa0Director of\\xa0Academic Operations\\xa0then counsels students who are facing academic difficulties and applies any academic sanctions imposed at the discretion of the Committee. Good Academic Standing: Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership Batten BA candidates are considered to be in good academic standing at the end of a semester if, in that semester, they have: Completed at least 12 credits of coursework; Earned a minimum grade of C (or ‘CR’ for Fall 2022)\\xa0in all courses taken to fulfill the core major requirements; Earned a minimum Batten GPA of 2.500 in all classes required for the major; Have no more than one grade below C minus; Make satisfactory degree progress. To enroll for a seventh semester, students must have earned at least 84 semester hours (includes approved summer, transfer, AP, IB and dual enrollment credits). Academic Warning (formerly known as Academic Probation) Students who fail to earn good academic standing (as described above for the Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Leadership) will be placed on academic warning, pending review by the Academic Standards Committee. Students on academic warning will be required to meet regularly with the Director of Academic Operations beginning no later than the add period of the ensuing semester to develop and adhere to an individualized plan for academic success. They are also strongly urged to devote more time to their academic work and are referred to academic and student affairs support services. Students on academic warning who withdraw or take a leave of absence are eligible to apply for readmission. If the application is approved, they return on academic warning and must attain good academic standing by the end of the next semester or face suspension by virtue of two consecutive semesters on academic warning. Academic Suspension Students are subject to suspension after two consecutive semesters on academic warning, or if they fail to earn at least nine grade points in a semester. If this is a first suspension, then one full fall term and one full spring term must elapse before a student may return to the Batten School. The Academic Standards Committee will consider a student’s application for readmission when she or he can document overcoming the difficulties that led to the suspension. Students under suspension forfeit commitments of financial aid. Suspended students may not apply hours from other institutions toward their UVA degree. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals A student who wishes to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. The appeal must be submitted to the instructor in writing within 30 days of grade posting. If no resolution is reached, the student may submit a written appeal to the Academic Standards Committee. Other Academic Grievances All other academic grievances should be addressed to the Academic Standards Committee. Students will be notified of a decision within 14 days. Awards for Academic Excellence Commencement Honors Undergraduate students who have demonstrated high academic achievement in pursuit of the BA are eligible for commencement honors. Diplomas inscribed “with distinction” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.400 to 3.599. Diplomas inscribed “with high distinction” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.600 to 3.799. Diplomas inscribed “with highest distinction” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.800. Dean’s List Full-time candidates for the Bachelor of Arts who demonstrate academic excellence while taking a minimum of 15 credits of graded coursework are eligible for the Dean’s List of Distinguished Students at the end of each semester. Courses taken on a CR/NC basis are not counted toward the 15-credit minimum. A current minimum grade point average of 3.700 is necessary to be eligible for the dean’s list. Any student receiving an F, NC, or NG during the semester is not eligible for the dean’s list. The notation “Dean’s List” is posted on the student’s transcript within several weeks after the conclusion of the semester. Legacy Awards The Legacy Awards are for graduating BA students who have, in their own way, led the Batten School in five separate categories: Leadership, Integrity, Perseverance, Innovation, and Intellectual Curiosity. The late Frank Batten, Sr., desired that his company be distinguished by two things: extraordinary dedication to public service and outstanding performance. In honor of Mr. Batten and in the spirit of his words, every spring semester the Batten Undergraduate Council invites nominations for the Legacy Awards from all Batten students, faculty, and staff. Nominees must be Batten Bachelor of Arts degree candidates in the current academic year. Nominations are reviewed by a\\xa0committee of students, faculty and staff members who select student recipients for one of five Legacy Awards, each reflecting the virtues and experiences that distinguished Mr. Batten throughout his inspirational life. Pi Alpha Alpha Pi Alpha Alpha is the global honor society for public policy, public affairs, and public administration. There are more than 160 chapters located around the world at NASPAA member schools. Nomination to Pi Alpha Alpha is limited to students who have achieved academic excellence within the Frank Batten School of Leadership & Public Policy. Curricular Requirements Curricular Requirements: Bachelor of Arts To earn a BA from the Batten School, a student must present 120 credits of approved course work, which completes their general education curricular program (Engagements or\\xa0Disciplines Plus Pathway\\xa0as defined by the UVA College of Arts and Sciences), major requirements, and elective requirements. A note for Echols Scholars: The Batten School\\xa0waives\\xa0general education curricular requirements for Echols Scholars. No fewer than 96 of the 120 required credits must be passed on a graded (A-B-C-D) basis. All courses taken to fulfill general education curriculum, and major/minor requirements must be taken on a graded (A-B-C-D) basis. A candidate must earn a minimum grade of C\\xa0in all nine core courses in the Batten major\\xa0(i.e. all program courses except the special topics courses). A candidate must have earned a grade point average of at least 2.500 in all courses required for the major. No fewer than 60 credit hours must be taken at the University of Virginia. Following matriculation, all Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum)\\xa0must be completed at the University of Virginia and must be taken on a graded basis. AP credits from secondary school and transfer credits awarded before UVA matriculation may count toward the Literacies and Disciplines requirements (or Competency and Area requirements in the Traditional Curriculum), with the exception of the second writing requirement which must be completed at UVA. Dual-enrollment credit may not be used to meet first writing or foreign language requirements. The Batten School accepts the general education curricular program that a student begins in the College of Arts and Sciences. Refer to the College Curriculum section of the Undergraduate Record for a complete description of the general education curricular options and requirements. If a student is in another School at UVA before entering the Batten major, they will work in consultation with the Batten Academic Programs team and may likely need to complete the traditional general education curriculum. General Education Curriculum For students in the Batten major, the Batten curriculum fulfills the following literacy requirements for the College general education curricular programs (Engagements Pathway or\\xa0Disciplines Plus Pathway Curriculum): Rhetoric/Second Writing Requirement (3 credits) Quantification, Computation and Data Analysis (3 credits) External transfer students are required to complete the traditional general education requirements. For transfer students in the Batten major, the Batten curriculum fulfills the following traditional general education requirements: Second writing requirement (3 credits) Humanities (3 credits in Moral, Philosophical and Religious Perspectives group) Social Science (6 credits) Major Requirements The Batten major\\xa0consists of fourteen distinct three-credit\\xa0courses. The 42 credits required for the major cannot be double counted for any other 2nd major or minors except as delineated under the Second Majors section below.\\xa0See the Batten Programs/Courses page for detailed course information. Second Majors The following 2 nd majors ONLY are permitted to double count credits with the Batten major: Global Studies Six credits may be double counted between the Batten major and any of the Global Studies 2 nd majors. Students should work with their\\xa0Batten academic advisor and their Global\\xa0Studies 2 nd major advisor to determine which courses will count toward both majors. Government and Foreign Affairs Batten students with a 2 nd major in Government or Foreign Affairs may not count any politics courses that are fulfilling the 30 credits (distribution, concentration and/or elective credits) toward their Batten special topics requirements. However, Batten major courses can count toward the 12 credits of related coursework for the Government or Foreign Affairs 2 nd major. All Batten students with a Government or Foreign Affairs 2 nd major should consult with their Batten academic advisor\\xa0and their politics advisor to ensure they are properly fulfilling requirements for both majors. Curricular Requirements: Minor in Public Policy and Leadership To earn a Minor in Public Policy and Leadership, a student must present 18 distinct credits of approved course work, which completes the foundations, analysis, and special topics requirements. Courses used toward the Batten minor requirements\\xa0may not be double counted with any other major or minor. All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken on a graded (A-B-C-D) basis. Candidates for the minor must earn a minimum grade of C in all courses taken to fulfill the foundations and analysis courses (i.e. all courses except the special topics courses) and an overall grade point average of 2.0 for all courses taken for the minor.\\xa0Please view the course requirements listed on the Public Policy and Leadership Minor Programs/Courses page . Course Rules AP Credit If a course for which AP credits have been awarded is repeated at the University, the AP credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average. Attendance Given the intensive nature of the Batten curriculum, students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. When necessary, excuses for absence from class are arranged between the student and the instructor of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to discuss numerous absences with the instructor and the\\xa0Academic Operations team. If necessary, the student’s academic advisor\\xa0may ask the Department of Student Health to evaluate the effect of any illness on a student’s attendance and academic performance. Poor attendance may be taken into account by the instructor in any manner for grading purposes. The instructor will bring cases of excessive absence to the attention of the Academic Operations team. In the event that the student falls behind in course work for any reason, it is the responsibility of the student to make up the work in a manner that is approved by the instructor. Changes in Schedule Changes in students’ class schedules are made via SIS.\\xa0 If admission to a course requires the instructor’s permission, students should add their name to the instructor’s permission list and wait for an invitation to join the class. Note that being on a permission list does not guarantee that a student will be offered a space in a class.\\xa0 Students may add and drop courses through the deadlines stated in the current Schedule of Classes. Course Enrollment: Bachelor of Arts Students are required to register for a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester for full-time student status. The maximum course load of 17 credit hours may only be exceeded upon approval of the student’s academic advisor. Three-quarter time enrollment (7 to 11 credit hours) may be approved by\\xa0request and in consultation with the student’s academic advisor. See the part-time enrollment section of this Record for policies pertaining to enrolling in 6 credits or less. Course Enrollment Deadlines The Batten School takes seriously all deadlines related to course enrollment.\\xa0 Students are responsible for being aware of the well-publicized dates each semester for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from a course, or for changing the grading basis of a course. Students who miss these deadlines may be subject to enrollment penalties.\\xa0Students who wish to appeal penalties attached to missed deadlines must see the Director of Academic Operations. Students should enroll during pre-enrollment to avoid problems with tuition bills and financial aid. Registration is not complete until all fees have been paid or satisfactory arrangements have been made with Student Financial Services. Course Load Students are required to register for a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester for full-time student status. The maximum course load of 17 credit hours may only be exceeded upon approval of the student’s academic advisor. Courses Taken at Other Institutions Students who wish to take academic courses at another institution after matriculation at the University must have the prior written permission of their academic advisor.\\xa0 Permission is not granted unless students have at least a 2.000 cumulative grade point average (2.500 for courses taken abroad). After matriculation at the University, students may not fulfill literacy or discipline\\xa0requirements with transfer course work, the only exceptions being a foreign language course taught in the target country,\\xa0courses taught at the University of Virginia extension in Northern Virginia and the UVA direct credit study abroad programs.\\xa0 Subject to the above, work completed elsewhere with a grade of C or better is transferred in credits only; letter grades do not appear on the University’s official records.\\xa0 Students will receive no more, and may receive fewer, than the number of credits earned at the host institution.\\xa0 Of the 120 credits required for graduation, at least 60 must be taken at the University of Virginia.\\xa0 Twelve or more credits attempted in a single semester for work at another institution, including at a foreign institution, will constitute one of the eight semesters allotted for full-time study in the Batten School. Courses Taken in Other Schools of the University Students are subject to the course enrollment deadlines of the School in which the course is being offered.\\xa0 As such, Batten students taking courses in other schools of the University must follow that School’s deadlines for dropping, adding, and withdrawing from a class.\\xa0 Similarly, non-Batten students must abide by the Batten School’s enrollment deadlines when taking Batten courses.\\xa0 Non-Batten students who seek to withdraw from a Batten class after the Batten School’s deadline are to consult with the dean of the School of their enrollment. The student remains in the class unless that Dean’s office authorizes a late withdrawal. Disability Accommodation Students with disabilities should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC)\\xa0to arrange accommodations. The SDAC coordinates disability accommodations, which may include alternate text formats for course material, peer note-taking, extended time for tests, sign language and other interpreting, and housing arrangements. Initial evaluation of academic difficulties is also available as needed to students who pay Student Health fees. Students with disabilities must submit appropriate documentation to the SDAC\\xa0in support of a request for accommodations. All accommodation requests must be submitted in a timely manner, usually at or before the beginning of each semester. For requests involving on-Grounds housing, appropriate deadlines within the Housing Office should also be met. Discontinuing a Course Students may not be removed from a course due to lack of skills or knowledge unless these requirements are identified in the course prerequisites.\\xa0 Students who decide to discontinue a course in which they have enrolled must use SIS to drop the course within the well-publicized deadlines.\\xa0 Students who fail to revise their list of current courses by using SIS within the deadlines become subject to penalties determined by the Academic Standards Committee.\\xa0 Students who fail to appear for the\\xa0first class meeting and who have not made arrangements with the instructor are subject to disenrollment from the course.\\xa0 However, it is the student’s responsibility to drop the course via SIS by the drop deadline.\\xa0 After the drop period, students may withdraw from a course in SIS with a grade of W until eight weeks from the first day of the semester.\\xa0 After this point, students must either complete the course or, with the instructor’s endorsement, submit a request for an incomplete to the dean’s office.\\xa0 Students who discontinue a course at any point without complying with the proper procedure receive a failing grade. Dual Enrollment If a course for which dual enrollment credits have been awarded is repeated, the dual enrollment credits are disallowed.\\xa0 The repeated course is posted, with its credits counting toward graduation and its grade included in the computation of the grade point average.\\xa0 Dual enrollment credit may not be used to fulfill literacy or disciplines\\xa0requirements. Exclusion from Classes A student who is making no real progress in a class, or whose behavior is detracting from the class, may be excluded from that course by the Academic Standards Committee with a grade of W or F.\\xa0 Students have five calendar days following written notification of this exclusion in which to appeal.\\xa0 Until the final disposition of the appeal, the student is considered enrolled in the class. Graduate-Level Courses Undergraduate students\\xa0may not enroll in courses numbered 6000 and higher without the prior written approval of the course professor.\\xa0To make a request for enrollment in these upper-level courses, please submit the professor’s approval via email to your academic advisor. Maximum Credit Hour Limits The maximum course load of 17 credit hours may only be exceeded upon approval by the student’s academic advisor. Original Work Students are required to submit their own work in all courses, properly citing the words and ideas belonging to others in all assignments, in accordance with instructor guidelines and the University of Virginia Honor System. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. Work that has been submitted as an assignment for one course may not be submitted as an assignment for another course without the explicit approval of the instructor. Part-Time Enrollment See the Student Status section of the University Regulations section for definitions of full-time, part-time and temporary part-time statuses. Students are ordinarily expected to be enrolled as full-time students.\\xa0 However, students may petition to enroll for a semester or two on a part-time basis.\\xa0 Part-time students are limited to a maximum of six credits.\\xa0 Students may not count more\\xa0than 16 credits taken on a part-time basis toward the degree.\\xa0 Students registered full time at the University have until the drop deadline at the beginning of the semester to request conversion of their registration to part-time status. This request is to be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee. Repeated Courses If a student earns D+, D, D-, F in a course and takes the course the second time for credit, only the highest grade will be included in the computation of grade point average; however, both grades will appear on the student’s transcript. This GPA adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of courses that are repeated and where both the original and the repeated course are completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester.\\xa0 A student may repeat a course only once. If a Batten student earns a grade of C- or higher and takes the course the second time for a letter grade at UVA, only the highest grade will be included in the computation of grade point average; however, both grades will appear on the student’s transcript. This GPA adjustment applies only to the total of 9 credits of courses that are repeated (which includes any repeated courses, including those in which students earned D+ or lower). The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester.\\xa0 A student may repeat a course only once. Before deciding to repeat a course, it is important for students to meet with their academic advisors to ensure they are making the best decision for their academic situation and goals. Two essentially different courses offered under the same course number may both be counted for degree credit upon the written recommendation of the Director of Academic Operations. Simultaneous Enrollments Students may not enroll in two courses that meet at the same time.\\xa0 In the rare case where this is necessary, students must obtain the written approval of both instructors and the Director of Academic Operations of the Batten School.\\xa0 The faculty have the authority to require 100 percent attendance and participation in the scheduled courses.\\xa0 The dean’s office, upon request from a faculty member, may disenroll a student, with a grade of W, from one of the courses. Student Email Email is a mechanism for official communication within the University of Virginia. The University has the right to expect that such communications will be received and read by students in a timely fashion. Official email communications are intended only to meet the academic and administrative needs of the campus community. Official University email accounts are available for all enrolled students. The email address for a student is: computingID@virginia.edu. This account must be activated by the student before the University can correspond via the official email account. When students use non Virginia.edu email accounts, it is their responsibility to make sure their UVA mail is forwarded to that account. Degree Information Degree Application To receive a degree, students must comply with the procedures administered by the Batten Academic Operations team. The application process for May graduation begins in October, with the final deadline to file a May degree application falling on February 1. The application deadline for August graduation is June 1, and for December graduation the deadline is October 1. Students who miss a deadline may apply for the subsequent graduation date and must be registered for the semester in which it occurs. Degree Completion: Bachelor of Arts All work for the Bachelor of Arts must be completed within eight semesters of matriculation and with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50. In serious medical or extenuating personal circumstances and upon approval of a petition to the Academic Standards Committee, a student may be permitted to enroll as a full-time student in a ninth semester. The student must be registered in the Batten School during the semester in which they are an applicant for a degree. Degree Requirements: Bachelor of Arts To earn a BA from the Batten School, a student must present 120 credits of approved course work, which completes their general education curricular program (Engagements or Disciplines Plus Pathway\\xa0as defined by the UVA College of Arts and Sciences), major requirements, and elective requirements. A note for Echols Scholars: The Batten School waives\\xa0general education curricular requirements for Echols Scholars. No fewer than 96 of the 120 required credits must be passed on a graded (A-B-C-D) basis. All courses taken to fulfill general education curriculum, and major/minor requirements must be taken on a graded (A-B-C-D) basis. A candidate must earn a minimum grade of C\\xa0in all nine core courses in the Batten major\\xa0(i.e. all program courses except the special topics courses). A candidate must have earned a grade point average of at least 2.500 in all courses required for the major. Eligibility and Completion of Degree Requirements Students in the Batten School, who, while studying elsewhere, declare a major there, are considered to have transferred from the University. If they seek to return to the Batten School, they must apply as transfer students via the Office of Admission. Students who have completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree elsewhere may not enroll in the Batten Bachelor of Arts program. A student who has received a baccalaureate degree cannot submit any courses offered for that degree toward another degree in the University. Students are subject to all requirements in effect during the academic year when they first enter the Batten School. Residency Requirement: Bachelor of Arts No fewer than 60 credit hours must be taken at the University of Virginia. Final Examinations Final Examinations Final examinations are to be given only at the time announced by the University Registrar. Under no circumstances should class time be used for the administration of final examinations. An instructor may, however, give the examination on a “take home” basis during the examination period. Students who are scheduled to take three final examinations within 24 hours may approach an instructor with a request to make up one of those examinations in accordance with the following policy. A student who wishes to request the postponement of an examination under rare, extenuating circumstances beyond his or her control must contact the instructor no later than one week before classes end. Absence from a final examination for any course offered in the Batten School may be excused only by the Director of Academic Operations, and then only when accompanied by evidence of arrangement with the instructor for a deferred examination, to be taken within ten days after the regular examination. An emergency that justifies extension of this period will be considered only when supported by satisfactory documentation submitted immediately after the period of emergency. After the ten-day period, or its extension if granted by the Director of Academic Operations, the temporary grade of IN (incomplete) will officially become a grade of F unless the deferred examination has been completed. Absences are excused only for sickness on the day of the examination or for other providential causes acceptable to the Director of Academic Operations. An excused absence may be absolved by taking a special examination at a time mutually acceptable to the instructor and the student. Special examinations are not granted for reasons other than those stated above. Unexcused absence from an examination incurs an automatic failure in the course with a grade of F. Grades Grades The academic performance of a student in each course taken for a grade is recorded as one of the following grades: A+, A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F. All courses intended to fulfill degree requirements must be taken for a grade. Grade Appeals A student who wishes to appeal a grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. The appeal must be submitted to the instructor in writing within 30 days of grade posting. If no resolution is reached, the student may submit a written appeal to the Academic Standards Committee. Grade Changes Errors in calculation or transcription are the only acceptable reasons for a grade change. Grades cannot be changed after a degree is conferred, or more than one semester following the end of the course, whichever comes first. Instructors may change grades electronically for winter term and spring semester through December 31 of that year, and for summer sessions and fall semester through May 31 of the following year. After this point, instructors must submit a grade change request to the Batten School Academic Operations\\xa0team. Incomplete and Missing Grades The symbol IN (incomplete) is used when additional course work or examination is required to fulfill the obligations of a given course. A student may not request an incomplete in an attempt to raise his or her grade. An IN is not a valid final grade and becomes an F 30 days after the grading deadline (200 days for graduate students), unless the student requests an extension from the course instructor prior to the end of the course\\xa0and secures approval. The time allowed to complete course requirements is determined between the student and the instructor\\xa0but may not exceed one semester beyond the term in which the student took the course. Students must enter into a written agreement with the instructor, specifying the remaining requirements and timeline. If the student fails to fulfill the agreement, the grade automatically becomes an F unless it is changed by the instructor. Grade changes from IN to a final grade cannot be made more than one semester following the end of the course. Students will not be permitted to take an incomplete in coursework one semester, and then request to take an incomplete the next semester if the incomplete from the previous semester is not resolved first. Credit/No Credit Grades Students have the option of receiving the grades CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of the regular grades A through F for a given course.\\xa0 This option is taken at the time the student registers for the course and no later than the add deadline.\\xa0 The Professor has the right to deny students permission to take their course on a CR/NC basis.\\xa0 If this occurs, students may either change back to the regular grading option or they may drop the course entirely.\\xa0 Courses taken for CR/NC may not be used for any Batten major or minor or general education curriculum\\xa0requirements.\\xa0 It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor the minimum academic level of achievement for the grade of CR. Intra-University Transfers Transfers to\\xa0The Batten School Students who have accepted admission into the Batten School will officially transfer from the former School of Enrollment to the Batten School. Prospective transfers are encouraged to visit the Batten School’s website for current and accurate information about academic policies. Transfer Back to The College Undergraduate students enrolled in the Batten School may apply to transfer back into the College.\\xa0 With very limited space in the College, Intra-University transfer into the College is not assured.\\xa0 Students seeking to transfer into the College may submit applications in either the fall or spring semester.\\xa0 Information and application forms are available on the College of Arts and Sciences website . Prospective transfers are encouraged to visit the College’s website for current and accurate information about academic policies. Leaving and Returning to the University Please refer to the University Regulations: Academic for policies on Leaving and Returning to the University. Entering Students Whose Medical Circumstances Preclude Enrollment Entering students who for significant medical reasons need to discontinue their enrollment in the Batten School after the first day of the semester must withdraw from the University as noted below.\\xa0 They may return in accordance with Batten policy on readmission. Students who withdraw from the semester may take courses elsewhere with the prior permission of the Batten Academic Operations team, and in accordance with Batten policy on transfer credit.\\xa0 All such course work will be as elective credit only. Enforced Withdrawal Students may be forced to withdraw from the University for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault that prevents the student from fulfilling the purpose implied by enrollment at the University. Further Information on Withdrawal For further information about voluntary withdrawal, medical withdrawal, and enforced withdrawal please see the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 Students on financial aid should consult the X Financial Aid X page for additional information.\\xa0 Any questions about tuition and fees for withdrawn students should be directed to Student Financial Services . Leave of Absence The Batten School expects students to register each semester and proceed to the completion of their degree programs.\\xa0 However, students may request to take a leave of absence, which is valid for up to two consecutive semesters.\\xa0 Students who plan to be away from the University in a subsequent semester (or semesters)\\xa0should file for a Leave of Absence. The Leave of Absence form must be filed no later than the day before the beginning of the semester the student plans to be on leave.\\xa0Due to the sequencing and progression of the Batten School curriculum, permission to take a leave of absence is subject to review by the Academic Standards Committee and is granted only in rare circumstances. Students in the Batten School who have been on an approved leave of absence apply for readmission when returning to the University (see below).\\xa0 Students who enter a degree program at another institution, however, must reapply to the University as transfer students and are not guaranteed acceptance. Medical Withdrawal Due to significant medical reasons, a student may need to withdraw from the University.\\xa0 A student may withdraw for medical reasons at any point in the semester, with the same conditions and restrictions applying as with a voluntary withdrawal.\\xa0 In addition, students who return to the Batten School after a medical withdrawal must be cleared by Student Health (see Readmission below). In very unusual medical circumstances, documented by professional certification, a Batten student who did not withdraw during the semester has one semester in which to petition for a retroactive medical withdrawal.\\xa0 If approved, all grades convert to W’s and the student is obliged to be absent for a full semester before resuming full-time study. Readmission Students should consult “Returning to the University” in the University Regulations—Academic section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University.\\xa0 Application for readmission must be made to and approved by the Academic Standards Committee in accordance with the Batten School’s readmission deadlines and policies. Students will be notified in writing of the Batten School’s decision on readmission.\\xa0 For readmission following a medical withdrawal, students should also follow the steps outlined by Student Health . Voluntary Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the University before the conclusion of a semester, specifically up to the last day of the final examination period,\\xa0if they meet the conditions stated in the University Regulations section of this Record.\\xa0 However, students in the Batten School who withdraw within 10 class days immediately preceding the final examination period are not permitted to reenter the Batten School for the succeeding semester nor to present transfer credit earned during the same time.\\xa0 A grade of W will be entered for each course in which the student was registered.\\xa0 Students initiate the withdrawal process with the Assistant Dean for\\xa0Academic Programs. Involuntary Medical Withdrawal Students who are withdrawn from the University by the Department of Student Health for reasons of health will receive a grade of W (withdrawal) for each course in which the student was registered. Majors and Minors Second Major/Minor\\xa0in Other Schools at the University (including the College of Arts and Sciences) Batten BA candidates may have one major and/or\\xa0one or two minors in another School at the University of Virginia. The student must obtain prior admission from the chair or director of undergraduate programs of the School or College program or department in which the student seeks the major or minor(s). Courses may not be double counted toward the fulfillment of second major or minor requirements unless formally approved by the Batten School and the School hosting the second major or minor. In pursuing the above, the student will not receive two degrees from the University.\\xa0The student receives a Bachelor of Arts from the Batten School. The second major and/or minor designation appears as degree information on the official transcript. This information does not appear on the diploma. Students are responsible for completing the major or minor form (available in the other School) and for obtaining the signature of the chair or director of the undergraduate program. Students must submit completed forms to the Batten Academic Operations Manager, who verifies the satisfactory completion of requirements after the student applies to graduate. Batten undergraduates majoring and/or minoring in another School at UVA are required only to satisfy the general education curricular requirements of the Batten School. Study Abroad Eligibility To study abroad, students must be in good academic standing and have a cumulative GPA at UVA of no less than 2.500 at the point of application to study abroad.\\xa0 Any student who does not meet either criterion must submit a petition to their Batten academic advisor\\xa0to be considered for an exception.\\xa0 These standards apply both to direct-study programs and the traditional study abroad programs under auspices of another institution or organization.\\xa0 Participation in study abroad is on a competitive basis; acceptance may be based on criteria beyond minimum cumulative GPA. With approval of the academic advisor, students may study abroad in their seventh semester. Students who do so accept the risk of not graduating on time if their grades, for any reason, are not received by the deadline set by the University Registrar. General Participation in study abroad enhances the academic program and provides a unique opportunity to experience another culture and function professionally in an international environment. Batten students wishing to study abroad should visit the International Studies Office in Minor Hall and their Batten academic advisor\\xa0to explore the various opportunities available. A maximum of 60 non-UVA credits from other universities, foreign study (the University’s direct-study programs exempted), advanced placement, or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. in Public Policy and Leadership. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students participating in semester- or year-long Study Abroad programs (not summer programs) are, like their full-time counterparts in Charlottesville, expected to complete at least 12 credits each semester.\\xa0 Whether on direct credit programs or other approved programs, students who study abroad for a semester use one of the full-time semesters of full-time study they are allotted. Transfer Credit Advanced Placement (AP) Credit The Batten School accepts the College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP) Program by awarding advanced standing or advanced placement to entering students who have made specified scores on AP exams.\\xa0For more information on transfer credit received based upon specific scores on various AP tests please consult the table found in the section on Admission in the general University section of this Record. International College-Level Examinations The Batten School offers possible advanced standing credit and/or advanced placement for many international college-level examinations. Transfer Credit If a course taken elsewhere and transferred to the University is repeated and passed at the University, only the credits awarded for the transferred course count toward the 120 credits required for graduation.\\xa0 The course repeated at the University does appear on the student’s transcript, but the grade earned does not enter into computation of the grade point average, nor do the credits earned count toward the 120 required for graduation.

Core Nursing Courses: Forty-two credit hours are awarded for core academic nursing courses taken in the student’s basic nursing program that are comparable to core courses in UVA’s traditional BSN programs. Students must have dedicated courses for lifespan development, pharmacology, and health assessment. These courses are included in the 42 core credit hours. Academic Advising Cooperation and personal attention mark the relations between advisors and students. Each undergraduate student is assigned an academic advisor upon admission to the school, and students are encouraged to avail themselves of this resource. The School of Nursing Office of Admissions and Student Services (OASS) provides assistance and serves as a source of information for other support resources. Nursing students are required to meet with their academic\\xa0advisor once every semester. An advising hold, preventing enrollment in the following semester’s courses,\\xa0is placed on the student’s account and cannot be lifted until that meeting has taken place. This hold can only be lifted by the student’s academic advisor. Academic Standing Good Academic Standing First-year students in the pre-professional component of the program are considered to be in good academic standing if they earn no more than one grade below C-. Additionally, first year nursing students are required to earn a minimum C- grade in anatomy and physiology, chemistry, microbiology, lifespan development and cells to society. Students who do not earn a C- or higher in either semester of anatomy and physiology, chemistry, microbiology, lifespan development or cells to society are required to retake the course(s). This may alter the planned sequence of courses and may lengthen the time for completion of the program. Second-, third-, and fourth- year\\u202fstudents in the professional component of the program are considered to be in good academic standing if they have a semester average of at least 2.000 and no grades below a C- in required nursing courses, regardless of the semester average. Grades of D and F are failing grades for all required nursing courses in the professional component of the program. Students earning a grade of D or F in a required course in the professional component will be placed on academic warning and must successfully repeat the course with a grade of C- or above. This may alter the planned sequence of courses and may lengthen the time for completion of the program. First year students must maintain a semester grade point average (GPA) of 1.8. Students who do not meet these standards will be placed on academic warning. Nursing students in years two, three, or four will be placed on academic warning if their semester GPA\\u202ffalls below 2.0.\\xa0 All undergraduate students will be required to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 for all credit hours attempted to maintain financial aid eligibility. A grade of D is included in the student’s GPA and counts toward credits earned. An F grade is included in the student’s GPA but does not count toward credits earned. A nursing student is subject to suspension if (1) the student earns a total of two D’s or one F at any time in the professional component of the program (years two through four), (2) the student’s GPA is below 2.000 for two semesters,\\u202f(3) the student has been placed on academic warning two semesters, or (4) the student\\u202fearns fewer than 9 credits in a semester. All components of core nursing courses (lecture, lab, clinical, etc.) must be successfully passed to progress in the program. Students must meet the clinical and course objectives as outlined in the course syllabus. A grade below a C- in a core nursing course must be repeated and may alter the planned sequence of courses, lengthening the time for completion of the program. Students who withdraw from a core nursing course will need permission from the BSN program director and Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. Withdrawing from a core nursing course will alter the planned sequence of courses, lengthening the time for completion of the program. Statement of Policy: Academic Action Plans The UVA School of Nursing expects all students to meet established academic standards satisfactorily for all course requirements, including meeting learning objectives, clinical practice objectives/standards, and professional standards of behavior for safe and quality nursing practice. This policy promotes academic achievement, maintains academic and professional standards, and achieves fairness and consistency in decisions about students with academic or professional concerns. Faculty members as course professors or clinical instructors are responsible for assessing and monitoring each student’s academic and professional progress, including knowledge gained, skills acquired, and professional behavior, as well as adherence to policies and procedures concerning clinical education and the health system/clinical facility policies. A student’s failure to meet the established academic, clinical and/or professional standards requires faculty documentation of an academic action plan and may be initiated at any time. This process is intended for faculty members to address single instances of significant errors (such as failure of an exam or a medication error) and patterns (such as repeated tardiness to clinical). Consequences for a student with 3 or more notices: Remediation is required (may occur over summer or winter break). A review of the academic action plans is conducted by the program director (or delegate) and the Senior Assistant Dean of Academic & Student Services to determine whether a revised plan of study is needed, or in rare instances, withdrawal from the program. Faculty should refer to the SON Faculty/Staff Handbook for procedures with Academic Action Plans. Appeals from Students Grade Appeals Students who wish to appeal a course grade must first attempt to resolve the issue with the instructor of the course. Absent a satisfactory outcome, the student consults their academic advisor before meeting with the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. The student will be advised by the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services to file a formal appeal to the Associate Dean for Academic Operations (ADAO).\\xa0 The appeal letter must address the grounds for the appeal including any claims of grading errors, perceived inequities based on policies/syllabi discrepancies or extenuating circumstances.\\xa0\\xa0If an appeal letter addresses all the aforementioned components, the ADAO will gather any relevant additional information and forward to the dean for consideration. For grades awarded for the fall semester, the written appeal must be submitted no later than 14 calendar days after the beginning of the spring semester. For grades awarded for the spring semester or summer sessions: the written appeal must be submitted no later than 14 days after the first day of the fall semester. For January term, a written appeal must be submitted no later than 14 days after the end of that session or term. Appeals submitted after the deadline will be heard only in exceptional cases, as determined by the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. The dean shall make a final decision after full consideration of the materials submitted to the ADAO and/or a committee’s recommendation.\\xa0 The student will be notified of the decision within three weeks of receipt of the student’s appeal. Academic Grievances University policy and procedures are described in PROV-019 for students seeking to appeal an academic decision as defined in that policy. Nursing students seeking to appeal an academic decision must follow the procedures outlined in PROV-019 and the contacts/procedures as outlined above for appealing a grade. Awards for Academic Excellence Dean’s List The School of Nursing recognizes exceptional academic achievement attained by undergraduate nursing students each semester. The requirements for this honor include: No grade below D No grade of NC, NG, IN or U 15\\xa0hour minimum number of graded credits Minimum semester grade point average of 3.700 Distinguished Majors Nursing students who demonstrate superior academic performance (GPA of 3.4 or above) are encouraged to apply for the School’s Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) to pursue a substantive project of their own that they would not have the opportunity to develop as part of their regular program of study. The application process requires students to define a detailed research project and to obtain agreement of a faculty member to guide the research. Once accepted in the program, students design and implement their research project as part of the Distinguished Majors Seminar I (3 credits in the Fall) and Seminar II (2 credits in the Spring). The research should be focused and well-defined, but it should also shed light on broader themes and questions within the general field in which the thesis falls. The final project should result in a manuscript, suitable for publication, and a public presentation. Graduation with Distinction Diploma with Distinction: Diplomas inscribed “with Distinction” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative UVA grade point average of 3.400 and successfully completed the Distinguished Majors Program, or to students with a cumulative UVA GPA of 3.750 who have not completed the Distinguished Majors Program. Diploma with Highest Distinction Diplomas inscribed “with Highest Distinction” are awarded to graduates who have earned a cumulative UVA GPA of 3.750 and have successfully completed the Distinguished Majors Program. Professional\\xa0Requirements Clinical Agencies: Responsibilities and Compliance with Affiliation Agreements Policy Formal affiliation agreements are executed with all agencies prior to placement of students in clinical sites to provide direct care to patients.\\xa0 If the student is an employee of the agency, an agreement is still needed with the agency. While performing the practicum activities, the individual is in the role of student, not employee. Therefore, they would be considered an agent of the University. Agreements must be fully executed and include the signatures of the authorized representative of the facility, a representative of the School of Nursing, and the University Director of Financial Operations (Office of Tax Compliance & Contracting). Students will be placed in clinical sites only when enrolled in a credit-bearing course for which the student\\xa0paid tuition and in which participation in the clinical experience is a course requirement. This applies to all clinical experiences that require the student to have patient contact. The faculty member placing students and the students assigned to agencies are responsible for knowing and adhering to the contents of the affiliation agreement, including its conditions and responsibilities. The School does not provide legal advice to the student regarding whether to submit to the conditions set by the facility. The School does not pay any student costs related to the clinical experience. If the student declines or fails to participate in or complete the clinical experience and the experience is a requirement for the course, the student will not successfully complete the course and may not graduate. The student is solely responsible for the consequences of their\\xa0decision regarding whether to submit to the conditions or requirements established by the facility. Students who are unable to finish clinical hours within the term\\xa0are required to have written approval of the faculty member and must submit the Incomplete Grade Form for approval.\\xa0Students cannot begin clinical hours before the semester begins. Clinical Agency Requirements Students must meet the required competencies of the clinical agency to which they are assigned as outlined in the clinical agency contract.\\xa0 This may include requirements such as respiratory mask fit, infection control training, criminal background investigations, and mandatory drug screening. Truescreen (My Record Tracker) The School of Nursing uses Truescreen’s MyRecord Tracker for the management of student competencies and compliance. Students must submit and update documentation required by the School of Nursing and affiliated clinical facilities such as a criminal background check, CPR certification, immunizations, trainings, flu vaccinations, signed program forms, drug screens as needed, and RN licensure for RN to BSN students. Clinical Practice of Students As denoted in 18VAC90-27-110 in the Code of Virginia, a nursing student, while enrolled in an approved nursing program, may perform tasks that would constitute the practice of nursing. The student shall be responsible and accountable for safe performance; refer to the code for more information. CPR Certification Students are required to obtain certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation for adults, children, and infants prior to entering clinical courses. Certification must be maintained throughout the program and must be renewed every 2 years. Recertification documentation must be uploaded to the student’s MyRecord Tracker account in Truescreen prior to expiration. Students must complete the American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Health Care Providers course. Criminal Background Check (CBC) and Drug Screening All students are required to complete a criminal background check prior to course enrollment in the School of Nursing. The Office of Admissions and Student Services communicates this requirement to students. Additionally, different clinical agencies may require students to undergo a criminal background investigation and/or drug examination using their own vendor when students are assigned to clinicals beginning in the second year. Students should refer to the Virginia Board of Nursing (or the Board for the state in which they plan to seek licensure) for information on criminal background checks required for licensure and barriers to licensure. Mandatory Clinical Training Requirements EPIC is the electronic health record (EHR) used at UVA Health. All second year BSN students and first year Accelerated BSN students are required to complete mandatory UVA Health and Epic training prior to beginning clinical experiences.\\xa0 UVA Health training requirements are assigned through Workday. Clinical ID Requirements When functioning in the role of a UVA clinical practicum student, regardless of any other affiliation that the student may have with the facility where the practicum is being performed, the student must wear the UVA identification badge that identifies the student as a nursing student.\\xa0 This requirement applies to UVA Health and third-party facilities. The UVA ID badge must be surrendered to the Program Coordinator, UVA clinical faculty, or UVA Nursing Information Systems once the need for the badge no longer exists.\\xa0 To surrender the badge to UVA Nursing Information Systems, students should visit McLeod Hall, Room 3014, or postal mail the badge to UVA Nursing Information Systems, PO Box 800782, Charlottesville VA 22908-0782. Insurance Students who are billed the regular session comprehensive fee are required to have student health insurance coverage.\\xa0 Those students must be insured under the University’s Student Health Insurance Plan or by another insurance contract that the University has agreed to be comparable in benefits to the University’s Student Health Plan. Proof of comparable insurance is submitted via the hard waiver option in SIS and uploaded in Healthy Hoos.\\xa0 Students who are billed the regular session comprehensive fee must present proof of insurance along with their Pre-Entrance Health Forms. See the Student Health Requirements in the University Regulations: Non-Academic section of the Undergraduate Record for more details. NCLEX Preparation Program All pre-licensure nursing students use Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) Nursing Education program to help prepare them for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX).\\xa0 This program includes learning and assessment activities, such as case studies, supplemental review materials, quiz banks, and practice exams. The materials are assigned in selected courses as a prescribed percentage of the course grade. The program includes specialty and cumulative proctored examinations. Students scoring below the recommended benchmark on a specialty exam are required to complete an individualized remediation (review) plan and submit appropriate documentation of their work, and retake the exam, if applicable. Students who do not show substantial improvement upon remediation will be required to meet with a faculty member to discuss study and test taking strategies. Patient Confidentiality Guidelines The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has important personal and professional implications for SON faculty, staff, and students. The regulations prohibit the disclosure, intentional or otherwise, of patients’ Protected Health Information (PHI), including electronic PHI (ePHI). These regulations apply to information contained in any format, including electronic and hard copy health records. Patient information may not be reproduced (copied and pasted, photographed, printed and removed from a clinical facility, etc.). When noting information for an academic clinical assignment, students and faculty must consider carefully what clinical data is absolutely necessary for effective learning, and note only information free from all identifiers, and which also cannot be tied back to an identifiable patient.\\u202fFaculty, staff, and students are referred to the United States Department of Health and Human Services website for additional information:\\u202fhttp://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/. Students are required to complete HIPAA training through WorkDay. Students found to be in violation of patient confidentiality guidelines and/or HIPAA may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, which could include monetary fines. Student violations of patient confidentiality guidelines will be reported to the health system whose privacy policy was violated, the UVA Honor Committee and the School of Nursing. Disciplinary action for the violation may include dismissal from the program. Technology Requirements All graduate nursing students are required to have a laptop. In addition, all NP and CNS students need to have cell phone access during their practicums in case of emergent issues. Information on the laptop requirements is available in the New Student Steps portion of the SON website. Respiratory Mask Fit (RMF) All pre-licensure nursing students assigned to clinicals\\xa0are required to be fitted for respiratory\\xa0masks annually. Students\\xa0must complete this requirement prior to enrollment in clinicals. The cost for the fit test is covered via the Clinical Services Fee. The student is responsible for any cancellation fees. Transportation Policy Nursing students are responsible for all arrangements and expenses for travel to and from clinical sites and other educational experiences. Students may need a car accessible to them. Carpooling is encouraged. Typhon The School of Nursing uses the Typhon\\xa0NSST system for student portfolio development and student clinical activity tracking throughout the BSN curriculum. Access to this system is required for all students. Pre-licensure students pay a one-time access fee. Initial training to Typhon\\xa0will be provided for all students. Ongoing use of Typhon\\xa0will continue throughout the program and access is available\\xa0for five years after graduation. Uniforms Students are required to follow the School of Nursing uniform policy for pre-licensure student clinical attire: www.nursing.virginia.edu/current-students/uniform/ . Workday Learning Throughout the educational experiences at the University, students\\u202fare required to complete competencies on a yearly, or more frequent,\\u202fbasis. These competencies are delivered\\u202fthrough the\\xa0UVA\\xa0Workday learning management system,\\xa0Workday. All students are required to complete\\xa0all\\xa0assigned and mandatory learning modules. Course Rules Attendance Regular attendance in classes and clinical is a vital part of the nursing program.\\xa0 At the University of Virginia each student is expected to accept the responsibility of attending classes and clinical regularly and promptly.\\xa0 Instructors are encouraged to state their policy on attendance in course syllabi; any student whose attendance record faculty consider unsatisfactory will be referred to the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. If you are unable to attend class or clinical for any reason, including illness, you must notify your instructor in advance of the class or clinical (unless specified otherwise in the course syllabus). If you believe that you have an illness or are developing an illness (i.e., have symptoms such as fever, aches, or a cough), you should notify your instructor (unless specified otherwise in the course syllabus). Absences commonly excused are those that occur because of hospitalization, serious illness, death in a student’s family, religious observance, professional nursing conferences, or authorized participants in University events (i.e., ROTC, Division I athletes, etc.). Students anticipating the need to be absent are expected to consult with the instructor in a timely manner. Please consult the course syllabus for additional information. Instructors are not obligated to allow students to make up missed work; it is the instructor’s decision, not the dean’s, whether students may be allowed such a privilege. Neither the Department of Student Health nor the dean’s office issues excuses for class or clinical absence or for missed quizzes.\\xa0 Only when students are unable to contact instructors themselves (e.g., debilitating illness, leaving town suddenly for family emergencies, protracted absences) does the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services send notification to instructors; otherwise it is the student’s responsibility to consult directly with the instructor regarding absence from class or clinical. UVA nursing students taking courses in the College or other schools of the University are governed by the attendance regulations of the instructor in that division; unexcused absences from such courses are subject to the penalties prescribed. Class Scheduling Students change their class schedules via SIS . Students may add and drop full-semester courses through the deadlines stated in the University Registrar’s Academic Calendar. Overload of Credit Hours Traditional BSN students who wish to enroll in more than the allowed maximum credit\\xa0hours for their program (17)\\xa0must gain approval from the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. To receive approval, a student must complete a Request for Increased Course Load form (available at: https://community.nursing.virginia.edu/students/forms/).\\xa0The student\\xa0submits\\xa0the digitally\\xa0signed request to the School of Nursing Registrar’s Office for processing. RN-BSN students are part-time students and enroll in 6-7 credits/semester. Transfer of Courses The University of Virginia School of Nursing accepts a maximum of 60 credits of transfer credit from institutions other than the University of Virginia toward the baccalaureate degree. Students who receive advanced standing for a required course transferred into the University of Virginia from another institution may be responsible for replacing the credits not earned in that course with another course at the University. Exception: Upon completion of selected courses, RN to BSN students receive up to 42\\xa0hours of advanced standing credit for equivalent course credit earned in their basic RN program. Therefore, not all prior credit hours may be transferable for credit. For example, pharmacology, assessment, and life span are all part of the 42-credit-hour package of advanced credit hours; therefore, these credits do not transfer in as additional credits. Transferring out of the SON Nursing students who plan to pursue intra-university transfer into one of the other undergraduate programs at UVA need to meet with the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services prior to transferring out. Students pursuing transfer out may have one semester to be released from nursing requirements in order to take courses in their future program. It is the student’s responsibility to be accepted into another program. Once a student is approved for transfer out, the School of Nursing will not hold a place for the student to return. Degree Information B.S. in Nursing (BSN) The University of Virginia offers two tracks leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing:\\xa0A traditional BSN program and an RN to BSN completion program. The degree is awarded after satisfactory completion of a prescribed program of study. Graduates of the traditional BSN program are eligible to apply to take the National Council Licensure Examination. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is conferred by the general faculty upon candidates recommended by the School of Nursing faculty as having completed a prescribed course of study of no less than 120 credits with a cumulative grade point average of 2.000 (C).\\xa0\\xa0All\\xa0candidates for degree\\xa0must apply to graduate in SIS by the deadline stated by the University. Residence Requirement The residence requirement for a BSN is a minimum of two\\xa0academic years in the School of Nursing.\\xa0The residence requirement for RN to BSN students is two academic years (30 credits) in the School of Nursing. Final Examinations Final examinations are given in regularly scheduled courses during a designated period of time at the end of each semester.\\xa0 Final exams in courses may be given only at the times listed on the UREG (Office of the University Registrar) website. Examinations in courses not fitting the regular class times are scheduled by UREG in consultation with the instructor.\\xa0 Faculty members are not authorized to change the announced times of their examinations.\\xa0 Such changes may be authorized only by the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services, and then only for compelling reasons.\\xa0 All students must have the opportunity to take the exam at the time announced on the UREG website. Students are not permitted to take a final exam before its regularly scheduled time.\\xa0 When a student has three exams scheduled over two consecutive days, the student may request a postponement of one of their exams.\\xa0 The student must file the exam postponement request, endorsed by the instructor of the course, no later than one week prior to the first day of the examination period. Grades Credit/No Credit Grades Students have the option of receiving the grades CR (credit) or NC (no credit) in place of the regular grades, A through F, for a given course except for courses in the major or those that fulfill basic area competency\\xa0requirements.\\xa0Courses used to fulfill area requirements must be taken on a graded basis. Students may take up to 6\\xa0credit hours for CR/NC. This option is selected when students register for courses. The last day to change the CR/NC option is the same as the last day to add a course. Instructors may deny students permission to take courses on a CR/NC basis. If this occurs, students may either change back to the regular grading option or drop the course entirely. Students may not use a CR/NC course to repeat a course in which a grade has already been given. Repeated Course Policy Following University policy , a student who earns D+, D, D- or F in a course during their time at UVA can repeat the course once, and the following applies: Both the original and repeated course, and their grades, appear on the student’s transcript. Only the higher of the two grades will be used in calculation of the GPA. This grade adjustment applies only to the first 9 credits of repeated courses. The repeated course must be attempted no earlier than the Fall 2024 semester. Both the original and the repeat course must be completed at UVA and taken for a letter grade. The two courses, whether under the same course number or not, may not both be counted for degree credit. If students intend to repeat a course, they need to discuss their intentions with their academic advisor to ensure they are making the best decision for their academic situation and progress in the program. Grade Changes No final grade may be changed without the approval of the course instructor\\xa0after it has been\\xa0posted in the Student Information System (SIS). The School of Nursing is not authorized by the faculty to change a\\xa0final\\xa0grade,\\xa0except when an instructor certifies that, because of errors in calculation or transcription, an incorrect grade has been submitted. Extra work to raise a final grade, once submitted, is not permitted. Grades An undergraduate student’s work in a course is graded on the basis of A+ (100), A (95-99), A- (90-94), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D- (60-62) and F (59-0). Incomplete Grades An incomplete grade may be\\xa0given to students who are unable to complete scheduled\\xa0coursework\\xa0due to\\xa0reasons beyond their control.\\xa0\\xa0A grade of IN becomes an F 30 days after the end of the examination period unless a form requesting an extension of time has been signed by the course instructor and approved by the Senior Assistant Dean for Academic and Student Services. Instructors are not authorized to extend the time for completion of course work without the Dean’s approval. Forms for securing extensions are available from the School of Nursing website. Prior to the end of the course, students must initiate the request for an IN and secure the instructor’s approval. Students with two or more outstanding incomplete designations (in the same semester or cumulatively) may not enroll in courses in subsequent terms. Students who have had an incomplete grade lapse after 30 days and become an F may not enroll in courses in a subsequent term until the grade has been changed,\\xa0or\\xa0a new incomplete form has been approved and turned into the SON Registrar. A student’s degree cannot be conferred with a grade of Incomplete (IN) on record, even if that course is not required for the degree being sought. Leaving and Returning to the University Leave of Absence A student in good standing may request a leave of absence from the School of Nursing for up to two semesters. Refer to the “Leaving and Returning\\xa0to the University” section of the “University Regulations: Academic” section of this Record for more information. Leaving the University All policies, procedures, and timelines governing withdrawal from the University in its various forms (Enforced, Medical, Voluntary) are outlined in the “Leaving and Returning to the University” section of the “University Regulations: Academic” section of this Record. Readmission to the SON after Suspension or Withdrawal Students should consult “Leaving and Returning to the University” in the “University Regulations: Academic” section of this Record for policies that govern their readmission to the University. Students in the School of Nursing who have been suspended must wait one full fall term and one full spring term before being eligible to apply for readmission. A student who has been readmitted following suspension will be permanently dropped from the school if she or he becomes subject to suspension a second time. Nursing students on an approved leave of absence who wish to\\xa0return\\xa0do so by initiating the Return to the University process in the Student Information System (SIS). Minors and Second Majors Students who\\xa0decide to complete requirements for a minor or a second major must contact the department to request information on that course of study. Once a minor or second major has been declared, a declaration of major/minor form must be signed by someone in the major/minor department and then submitted\\xa0to School of Nursing Registrar. The second major or minor must be completed prior to or at the same time as the nursing major. Students may not return to the University to complete a second major/minor after the nursing curriculum has been completed. Courses that nursing students take that count toward their minor/second major may also be used to satisfy BSN general education and area requirements. Public Professional Licensure Disclosure As a member of the State Authorizations Reciprocity Agreement, the University of Virginia (UVA) is authorized to provide curriculum in a distance learning environment to students located in all states in the United States except for California. (34 CFR 668.43(a)(6)& 34 CFR 668.72(n)). Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing at the UVA School of Nursing, graduates may be eligible for initial professional licensure in another U.S. state by applying to the licensing board or agency in that state. Please visit the University’s state authorization web pages to make an informed decision regarding which states’ educational requirements for initial licensure are met by this program. (668.43(a)(5) (v)(A) - (C)) Enrolled students who change their current (or mailing) address to a state other than Virginia should update this information immediately in the Student Information System as it may impact their ability to complete internship, practicum, or clinical hours, use Title IV funds, or meet licensure or certification requirements in the new state. (34 CFR 668.402). Study Abroad The UVA School of Nursing is enthusiastic about preparing our nursing students to embrace the challenges and exciting opportunities of our global community.\\u202f Study abroad programs are centered around deep and sustainable global partnerships that integrate research, education, and clinical experiences. First year nursing students have the opportunity to participate in Valencia First!\\xa0 This global experience gives students a unique opportunity to begin their UVA career in Spain. Students will take their required first-semester nursing courses along with one Spanish language course. There will be opportunities for site visits to local hospitals and clinics, a speakers series featuring local medical experts, and a language partner program with local nursing students. The School of Nursing offers J-Term study abroad courses, interdisciplinary summer global health electives, and independent study opportunities.\\u202f A semester-long exchange program with the University of Queensland, Australia supports reciprocal studies and broadening cultural experiences for participating fourth-year students. Nursing students may pursue individual opportunities for study abroad through the University’s International Studies Office.\\u202f An interdisciplinary Global Sustainability minor complements the School of Nursing degree, preparing students to incorporate sustainable practices into their future careers. Transfer Credit The\\xa0School of Nursing\\xa0will consider requests for transfer of credit from other fully accredited two- or four-year colleges or universities for courses which may be equivalent to those in the baccalaureate or master’s nursing programs. Other University of Virginia faculty and departments may evaluate courses equivalent to those in other areas. Implementation of this policy will not negate the residency requirement policy. Undergraduate students may not transfer courses that are a required part of their curriculum in the Nursing school. Students may only transfer courses that fulfill their general education requirements. Please refer to this link for further information. Dual Enrollment Students who have taken dual enrollment courses while in high school must arrange to send an official transcript to nursing-admissions@virginia.edu. Transcripts will be evaluated as they arrive, and the credit will be posted in SIS. If dual enrollment credit is not posted by October of the first semester, check with the BSN Program Manager to see if transcripts have been received. You may not transfer in your first writing requirement through dual enrollment. International Baccalaureate Pre-approved departmental equivalencies for qualifying higher-level IB examination scores can be found here: http://college.as.virginia.edu/iclec . The School of Nursing accepts only IB scores sent directly from IB North America ( http://www.ibo.org ). We award no credit for standard-level\\xa0(SL) examinations. Advanced Placement\\xa0Credit The University of Virginia participates in the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program by awarding advanced standing (course exemption and academic credit hours) or advanced placement (course exemption without credit hours) to entering students who have qualifying scores on the Advanced Placement (AP) tests. Students may receive credit in any academic discipline in which an AP test is offered so long as the test was taken before the end of the senior year in high school. If an AP test was not taken in high school, one cannot be taken once a student has matriculated into the University. Also, if a student enrolls in\\xa0a course equivalent to that of an advanced placement course, the student waives the Advanced Placement credit. If a student places\\xa0out of a course without having received credit hours,\\xa0that course cannot count towards\\xa0degree requirements. Students may also earn course exemption (without credit) for qualifying scores on\\xa0foreign language tests. The University does not award credit\\xa0based on College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests; for information on possible placement refer to Admission . Accepted students should have AP score reports sent directly to the University Office of Undergraduate Admission (College Code 5820) in the summer following the senior year of high school. Be sure to ask that test scores include those taken\\xa0prior to your senior year be sent. For more information, visit AP Credit .

An important goal of the program is give students the ability to apply computing to other disciplines in the arts and sciences (e.g., life and physical sciences, mathematics, social sciences, visual and performing arts). This idea of studying computer science in the context of a liberal arts education is what distinguishes the BA in Computer Science from computing degrees in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Graduates of this program will be prepared to apply their technical knowledge to analyze and solve computing challenges in a wide range of problem areas, including those faced by today’s computing industry. Graduates will also be prepared for graduate study in computer science and other fields that require knowledge of computer science. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the (Add school name), students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Declaring the Major and Application Process Students must have successfully completed the pre-requisites described below in order to declare the major. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who have not completed CS 2100 by the end of their fifth semester\\xa0to complete the major in their three remaining semesters. Ability to complete the degree in a timely manner is a factor in acceptance into the major. Second Majors: Because the goals of the degree are integrated with the study of the liberal arts, students from outside the College of Arts and Sciences who have not taken significant coursework in the College will not be allowed to declare the\\xa0BA in CS degree as a second major. Students enrolled in the School of Engineernig and Applied Science are not allowed to declare the BACS as a second major. Transfer Students from Outside the University: Students transferring into the University from other institutions must apply to the department to be allowed to declare the BA in CS major. This should take place during the summer before a transfer student begins classes, and the overall process will be discussed during the summer orientation session. If an incoming transfer does not attend summer orientation, they must meet with a CS advisor before classes begin to discuss their request. Transfer students who start in the spring semester should contact the department when they begin to register for courses.',\n",

An important goal of the program is give students the ability to apply computing to other disciplines in the arts and sciences (e.g., life and physical sciences, mathematics, social sciences, visual and performing arts). This idea of studying computer science in the context of a liberal arts education is what distinguishes the BA in Computer Science from computing degrees in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Graduates of this program will be prepared to apply their technical knowledge to analyze and solve computing challenges in a wide range of problem areas, including those faced by today’s computing industry. Graduates will also be prepared for graduate study in computer science and other fields that require knowledge of computer science. Universal Curriculum Requirements To be awarded a degree from the (Add school name), students are required to complete universal curriculum requirements in addition to the program requirements provided below. The school universal curriculum requirements can be found on the school Degree Programs page . Declaring the Major and Application Process Students must have successfully completed the pre-requisites described below in order to declare the major. Due to prerequisite dependencies, it is difficult for students who have not completed CS 2100 by the end of their fifth semester\\xa0to complete the major in their three remaining semesters. Ability to complete the degree in a timely manner is a factor in acceptance into the major. Second Majors: Because the goals of the degree are integrated with the study of the liberal arts, students from outside the College of Arts and Sciences who have not taken significant coursework in the College will not be allowed to declare the\\xa0BA in CS degree as a second major. Students enrolled in the School of Engineernig and Applied Science are not allowed to declare the BACS as a second major. Transfer Students from Outside the University: Students transferring into the University from other institutions must apply to the department to be allowed to declare the BA in CS major. This should take place during the summer before a transfer student begins classes, and the overall process will be discussed during the summer orientation session. If an incoming transfer does not attend summer orientation, they must meet with a CS advisor before classes begin to discuss their request.
